          "description": "A public low-cost rabies vaccination clinic will be held for dogs, cats and ferrets by the Mahoning County Public Health department. Anyone attending the clinic must have pets on a leash, in a cage, or carried inside a pillowcase. This is a low-cost clinic that does not include a physical examination of the animal. The veterinary staff reserves the right not to vaccinate any animal in the event the animal appears to be in poor health. To receive the 3-year booster, bring proof of prior rabies vaccination on or after August 7, 2021. Without proof of prior vaccination, the pet will receive a 1-year vaccination only. No appointment is necessary.Costs are kept to a minimum through a sponsorship from Mahoning County Public Health and volunteer services provided by Mike Sabihi, D.M.V. and Angels for Animals.Rabies is a preventable, potentially deadly, viral disease most often transmitted through bites and scratches from unvaccinated pets, strays, and wildlife. In Mahoning County, rabies vaccination is required for all dogs, cats, and ferrets over 3 months of age.",
