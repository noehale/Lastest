          "description": "WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) — A new habitat opening at the Sedgwick County Zoo will showcase a once-thought-extinct species. The Rogers Family Ferret Habitat, which will bring black-footed ferrets to the zoo, opens Wednesday, Dec. 14. The species of ferret was thought to be extinct until 1981 when a population was discovered in Wyoming. A disease nearly wiped out that population which saw its numbers drop to just 18 by 1987. Thanks to intervention, the species was saved and has started to be reintroduced into the wild.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has reintroduced around 300 captive-bred black-footed ferrets in Wyoming, South Dakota, Montana, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Kansas, New Mexico, Canada, and Mexico. The zoo has been assisting in the recovery program, including participating in annual surveys and providing funding for supplies. The exhibit officially opens with a ribbon-cutting ceremony at 3 p.m. Wednesday. Admission to the zoo will be just $2 that day.

          "description": "I have been a huge animal person since I was a toddler. My parents said I always gravitated towards animals and books about nature even before I could talk. I’ve had hamsters, rats, chinchillas, hedgehogs, dogs, cats, snakes, and lizards. Now I joke that I was searching for ferrets all that time -I just didn’t know it yet!\nWhen I got Moose (my first ferret), I wasn’t actually planning on getting a ferret at all. I went to a pet store to purchase a hedgehog with my boyfriend at the time. I had already owned one so I knew what the care would entail. However, when we arrived at the pet store where we meant to go check out the hedgehogs, we were instead struck by how playful and adorable the ferrets were. Many people describe ferrets as a combination of the best qualities of a puppy and a kitten rolled into one. I can attest to that!\nThere was one particular little ball of fluff that caught my eye. He was very dark brown and sat all alone in the corner. I reached my hands into the tank and plucked him out. I set this little kit in the crook of my forearm, belly up, and he gazed right into my eyes. What really struck me is how calmly he sat there staring at me and taking this world in. That baby was Moose, of course, and it was absolutely love at first sight. I have been head-over-heels for ferrets ever since that day.\n#ferret #ferretgram #ferrets #instaferret #ferretism #ferretsofinstagram #フェレット #ferretlove #хорек #ferretlife #furet #frettchen #huron #fuzzbutt(Feed generated with FetchRSS)",

Without batting an eye, as if she’d rehearsed the answer her entire life, she said, “It’s talking about the cardinal.” Bingo.

          "description": "If you are a new ferret owner, it is vital that you provide them with all the best ferret supplies they need to stay happy and healthy. I have a Youtube video called \"Top Recommended Ferret Products\" that you can check out on Youtube through my link in bio.\nIn the meantime, here are some thoughts on food/water dishes: \nFerrets are notorious for knocking things over. This includes a lightweight food or water bowl. I recommend finding a set of heavy ceramic bowls that they are unable to move on their own. Make sure to place them on the bottom of the cage so they cannot fall and injure your ferret.\nYou can also opt to buy food and water bowls that attach to the cage. Many ferret owners have had great success with these as well.\nHope this helps someone today. Do you guys have any other suggestions for food and water bowls?\n#ferret #ferretgram #ferrets #instaferret #ferretism #ferretsofinstagram #フェレット #ferretlove #хорек #ferretlife #furet #frettchen #huron #fuzzbutt(Feed generated with FetchRSS)",
