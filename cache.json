          "description": "If you are a new ferret owner, it is vital that you provide them with all the best ferret supplies they need to stay happy and healthy. I have a Youtube video called \"Top Recommended Ferret Products\" that you can check out on Youtube through my link in bio.\nIn the meantime, here are some thoughts on food/water dishes: \nFerrets are notorious for knocking things over. This includes a lightweight food or water bowl. I recommend finding a set of heavy ceramic bowls that they are unable to move on their own. Make sure to place them on the bottom of the cage so they cannot fall and injure your ferret.\nYou can also opt to buy food and water bowls that attach to the cage. Many ferret owners have had great success with these as well.\nHope this helps someone today. Do you guys have any other suggestions for food and water bowls?\n#ferret #ferretgram #ferrets #instaferret #ferretism #ferretsofinstagram #フェレット #ferretlove #хорек #ferretlife #furet #frettchen #huron #fuzzbutt(Feed generated with FetchRSS)",

          "description": "Image source, GoogleImage caption, The venue originally opened as The Mad Ferret in 2006A city centre music venue could close unless campaigners raise the remaining £150,000 needed to buy the building it is housed in. The Ferret in Preston, which has hosted Ed Sheeran, Buzzcocks and Idles, is set to go on the market in three weeks. In May, the council temporarily blocked a commercial sale for six months to give locals time to prepare a bid. A buyer is yet to be found but the Music Venue Trust is stepping in to try raise the funds. The charity, which tries to save grassroots gig spaces, said it was seeking donations both locally and nationally. Chief Executive Mark Davyd said he was \"pretty confident\" that \"unless it's sold to us, we don't think it will be sold to be a music venue\". \"What we need to be able to do is go to the landlord and say we want to put a bid in - and do that before they go back to market.\"That building has to be a music venue - it's in the ideal place to be one. And it's so important to Preston, we know that,\" he added. The site, which employs about 10 staff, originally opened as The Mad Ferret in 2006 and became a cornerstone of the University of Central Lancashire's student quarter, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.The property, which is not wholly occupied by The Ferret, went on the market with a price tag of £795,000 back in March.It was described in the listing as having potential for a \"residential conversion\". A fundraising page set up last week has so far seen over £6,800 pledged.The venue's managing director Sue Culshaw said: \"Anybody can donate and it will give people a chance to show that they care about The Ferret. \"The building is back on the open market and anybody can step in and buy it - and either turf us out or raise the rent through the roof, whatever they choose.\"Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

          "description": "JUNCTION CITY (KSNT) – A new city ordinance has been approved in Junction City which limits the number of animals in each residence within city limits.  City Attorney of Junction City Britain D. Stites announced on Nov. 8 that the City Commission voted on and approved the new limits for animals per residence. Households may own, harbor or possess no more than six dogs, cats, ferrets or any combination of the three animals. The previous limit was set at 19, according to Stites. The City Commission determined to grandfather dogs, cats or ferrets which are licensed on or before Dec. 30, 2022 during regular business hours of the City’s Customer Service Office. Animals not licensed before January 1, 2023, shall not gain a grandfather status.  This new ordinance does not allow people to exceed the limitations on pitbull ownership or other limitations contained in the ordinances of the city. A 20-year-old pitbull ban in Junction City was lifted in 2020 allowing local residents to own two pitbulls per household.  Owners, harborers or possessors convicted of cruelty to animals or other similar ordinances and statutes shall have the grandfather status of their animals revoked.  If you have any questions, you can call the Customer Service Office at 700 N. Jefferson St. or the Junction City Animal Shelter at 2424 N. Jackson St. during their normal business hours to license your animals with the City. Bring a copy of the animal’s current rabies vaccination.  Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
