Dirty clothes smell the strongest so don‚Äôt be surprised if you find your ferret curled up in the pajama pants you threw on the floor.

Any piece of clothing could contain a ferret and if you step on them, you can cause serious injury. You have two options for this. You can either change your habits and keep all clothing off the floor, or you can shuffle your feet when you walk instead of stepping.\n#ferret #ferretgram #ferrets #instaferret #ferretism #ferretsofinstagram #„Éï„Çß„É¨„ÉÉ„Éà #ferretlove #—Ö–æ—Ä–µ–∫ #ferretlife #furet #frettchen #huron #fuzzbutt(Feed generated with FetchRSS)",
