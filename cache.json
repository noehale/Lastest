Some animal-loving woman tried to lure it back but it crossed the road and ended up in Columbus Circle.

It is such a blessing to be able to geek out about ferrets with you all. \nI have always loved animals but like I've said before, I think all along I was just looking for a ferret! They are the perfect pet in so many ways. Don't you agree? \nWas anyone else just looking for ferrets all along too? Why do they fit us so perfectly?\nLove you all!\nP.S. the sweatshirt in this picture is from my Etsy shop (link in bio)! It says 'Ferrets' in the style of the Friends TV show logo.\n#ferret #ferrets #ferretsofinstagram(Feed generated with FetchRSS)",

Dirty clothes smell the strongest so don’t be surprised if you find your ferret curled up in the pajama pants you threw on the floor. This can become dangerous when you keep clothes scattered all over your floor. Think of it like a ‘ferret mine field’. Any piece of clothing could contain a ferret and if you step on them, you can cause serious injury. You have two options for this. You can either change your habits and keep all clothing off the floor, or you can shuffle your feet when you walk instead of stepping.\n#ferret #ferretgram #ferrets #instaferret #ferretism #ferretsofinstagram #フェレット #ferretlove #хорек #ferretlife #furet #frettchen #huron #fuzzbutt(Feed generated with FetchRSS)",
