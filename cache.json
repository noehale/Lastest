          "description": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) - This week, 30 federally threatened black-footed ferrets were released on Colorado’s eastern plains.The ferrets, one of the rarest mammals in North America, were raised at a U.S. Fish and Wildlife breeding facility. According to CPW’s website, black-footed ferrets were thought to be extinct twice, and were absent from Colorado since the early 1940s. A small population was found in Wyoming in 1981, which was used to help boost populations in the region. Officials say that there are currently about 600 black-footed ferrets both in captivity and the wild, and that all black-footed ferrets are now descendants of that population found in Wyoming.The ferrets were first reintroduced to Colorado back in 2001. This week’s release marks the eighth release site in eastern Colorado. The ferrets were released land owned by the Southern Plains Land Trust.See video of the release from Colorado Parks &amp; Wildlife here:Copyright 2022 KKTV. All rights reserved.",

They’re friendly, smart, super curious and fun to hang out with!But when it comes to taking care of your new friend, you might be wondering — what do ferrets eat?To find out what the best foods are to feed your ferret (and those to avoid), we reached out to Samantha Henson, a certified clinical pet nutritionist with Next Generation Pet Wellness, and Dr. Robert Fillman, a veterinarian at GeoZoo (and ferret parent!).What do ferrets eat?Well, for starters, ferrets are carnivores — or more specifically, obligate carnivores. This means that their diet should consist of at least 70 percent meat.“Much like tigers, alligators and snakes, ferrets need meat to survive and cannot turn plant proteins into what their bodies need,” Henson told The Dodo. “They thrive on a di…",

THE FREAKING GOOGLY EYES!!\" So does anyone have some ferrets we can borrow? Not only are they adorable but they just made googly eyes that much more hilarious. Do you have a pet who's funny, smart, full of personality, or just downright adorable?

          "description": "The Watcher. (L to R) Luke David Blumm as Carter Brannock, Bobby Cannavale as Dean Brannock in episode 102 of The Watcher. Cr. Eric Liebowitz/Netflix © 2022A new mystery-thriller series titled The Watcher is now streaming on Netflix. It follows a family who after moving into their dream home, begins receiving threatening letters from a mysterious stalker called “The Watcher.” While watching the series, you might start to have questions. Actually, a question we’re seeing being asked a lot revolves around a ferret.Spoilers from The Watcher ahead!We’re introduced to the ferret in episode 1. As the Brannock family moves into the 657 Boulevard house, Carter comes down the stairs carrying his pet ferret named Sprinkles. He asks Dean where the ferret’s leash is, and Dean replies that he doesn’t know. Then, Dean tells Carter not to let Sprinkles run all over the house because he doesn’t want them peeing everywhere. Later in the episode, we find out that Dean and Nora bought Carter the ferret to make him feel comfortable about moving into the new house.Flash forward further into the episode, Sprinkles escapes from their cage and ventures around the house as the Brannocks are asleep. But then the ferret is snatched up by a person with black gloves. So, what happens to Sprinkles? Do they die?Sadly, Sprinkles does die. The next morning, Carter gets up and walks out of his room to find Sprinkles bleeding profusely from their head. Then, the Brannocks call the police to find out who broke into their home and killed Sprinkles. The detective tells them there’s nothing he can do because there’s no proof that someone broke in. He continues and says that all the doors were locked, and there were no signs of forced entry. By the end of the season, we never find out who killed Sprinkles.The Watcher is now available to stream on Netflix.Here’s more content on The Watcher to check out!

It’s not uncommon to feel this way after a long day at work or a night out with friends. However, there are times when this feeling can be more intense and last for several days. If you find yourself in this situation, it’s important to listen to your body and get the rest you need.It can be hard to let go of the things you need to do in order to get some rest, but it’s important to remember that your health comes first. If you’re feeling exhausted, try to take a nap or go to bed early. And if you find yourself struggling to stay awake, don’t be afraid to ask for help. There’s no shame in admitting that you need some assistance.In short, don’t push yourself too hard if you’re feeling tired. Get the rest you need and take care of yourself.

Now, however, it appears that the scientific community is largely in agreement that ferrets should, in fact, be classified as domestic animals.The primary argument in favor of classifying ferrets as domestic animals is that they have been domesticated for centuries, and are significantly different from their wild ancestors. Ferrets were first domesticated in Europe over 2,000 years ago, and were brought to the United States in the 1800s. They have been bred in captivity for generations, and their be…",

This can be a particular problem if the stairs are in a public place, such as in a shopping centre or office block. Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened to me last week.I was descending a flight of stairs in my workplace when I suddenly lost my footing and tumbled all the way down, landing in an undignified heap at the bottom. Fortunately, I was not seriously injured, though I did suffer some bruising.This incident has led me to think about the safety of stairs in our society. Surely, there must be a better way to design them so that accidents like mine are less likely to happen? I would like to see a change in the way that stairs are built so that they are safer for everyone.",

Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … We all know the saying, “April showers bring May flowers.” But what about the hidden gem of April- the moss! Too often we focus on the flowers and forget about the low-lying foliage that is essential to any garden.As we head into April, now is the time to start thinking about adding some moss to your landscape. Moss is a great way to add texture and interest to your garden. It can also help to control erosion on slopes and in shady areas where grass has a difficult time growing.If you’re thinking about adding moss to your garden, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, moss does best in cool, moist areas. so, if you live in a hot, dry climate, you may want to consider growing moss in a container instead of in your garden beds. Second, moss is a slow-growing plant, so be patient and be prepared to wait a few months for it to really start filling in.If you’re looking for a low-maintenance plant that will add a touch of beauty to your garden, consider moss. Just be sure to give it the cool, moist conditions it needs to thrive.",

Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … If you’ve been waiting to take your computer in for service because you can’t find a babysitter for your ferret, you’re in luck. Your wait is almost over.On April 1, Best Buy will begin offering ferret check and pick-up service at all of its stores in the United States. The service, which is free of charge, will allow customers to drop off their computers for service and pick up their ferrets at the same time.According to Best Buy, the new service was created in response to customer feedback. “We know that our customers love their ferrets, but they also need their computers fixed,” said a spokesperson for the retailer. “This new service will make it easier for them to get both done at the same time.”To take advantage of the new service, customers can bring their ferrets to any Best Buy store during regular business hours. A Best Buy employee will then check the ferret for any health concerns and provide a temporary cage for the animal while the customer’s computer is being serviced.Once the computer is ready, the customer can pick up both the computer and the ferret at the customer service desk. Best Buy says the entire process should take about two hours.So if you’ve been putting off getting your computer fixed because you didn’t want to leave your furry friend behind, there’s no need to worry any longer. Best Buy has you covered.",
