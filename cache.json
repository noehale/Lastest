          "description": "he went full cuteness mode\nWhen it comes to getting attention, few things are as effective as cuteness. And when someone really wants to lay it on thick, they‚Äôll go full cuteness mode.\nWhether it‚Äôs a baby making faces, a puppy wagging its tail, or a kitten playing with a ball of string, the power of cuteness is undeniable. And when someone really wants to ramp up the cute factor, they‚Äôll go all out.\nThey might make faces, use a high-pitched voice, or dress up in a cutesy outfit. Whatever the method, the goal is always the same: to look as adorable as possible.\nWhile it might seem like a desperate move, there‚Äôs actually a lot of strategy involved in going full cuteness mode. After all, it‚Äôs not easy to pull off. But when it‚Äôs done well, it can be extremely effective.\nSo next time you see someone going full cuteness mode, don‚Äôt be too quick to judge. They might just be trying to get your attention. And who knows? They might just succeed.",

Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 ‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre thinking about moving the toilet in your home, think again. It may seem like a good idea to change the location of the toilet, but there are a few things you need to consider before you make the change.For starters, the location of the toilet is determined by the home‚Äôs sewer line. The sewer line is the pipe that carries waste water from the home to the municipal sewer system. The location of the sewer line is typically governed by building codes, which means that if you move the toilet, you may also need to move the sewer line. This can be a costly and time-consuming project.Additionally, the toilet is connected to the home‚Äôs water supply. This means that if you move the toilet, you‚Äôll also need to reroute the water supply lines. This can be a tricky process, and if it‚Äôs not done correctly, it could result in a leak.Finally, you need to take into account the fact that the toilet is one of the most-used fixtures in the home. This means that relocating it could be a major inconvenience for you and your family.Therefore, before you make the decision to move the toilet, weigh the pros and cons carefully. It may be best to leave the toilet where it is.",

But what if your TV is broken? You may be in for a long, frustrating night.\nBut don‚Äôt despair! There are a few things you can do to try to fix your TV. First, check all the connections. Make sure the power cord is plugged in and that the TV is set to the correct input. If everything looks good there, try pressing the power button again.\nIf your TV still won‚Äôt turn on, there could be a problem with the power supply. Try unplugging the TV for a few minutes and then plugging it back in. If that doesn‚Äôt work, you may need to replace the power supply.\nIf your TV turns on but there is no picture, the first thing to check is the input. Make sure you have selected the correct input. If that doesn‚Äôt work, try adjusting the antenna or cable connection.\nIf you‚Äôre still having problems, it‚Äôs time to call a TV repairman. But don‚Äôt give up hope! With a little troubleshooting, you may be able to fix your TV yourself.",

          "description": "My wife got this picture and it made my three look like Cerberus\nCerberus, also known as the ‚Äúhellhound‚Äù, is a fearsome creature from Greek mythology. He is said to have three heads, each of which can breathe fire, and he guards the entrance to the Underworld.\nSo it‚Äôs no wonder that one father was surprised to see his three young children pictured with the dog-like creature in a photo his wife had taken. The children are pictured looking up at the camera with Cerberus in the background, and the father is clearly amazed by the resemblance.\nWhile it is certainly an unusual picture, it is also a very cute one. It‚Äôs clear that the children are not afraid of the so-called ‚Äúhellhound‚Äù and, in fact, seem to be quite fond of him.\nThis is just one example of the power of imagination and the ability of children to see the world in a different way to adults. It‚Äôs a reminder that, sometimes, the seemingly impossible can be completely believable to those with less experience of the world.",

He was found in an abandoned Austintown apartment, collapsed in a bathroom, unable to stand, according to an Animal Charity Facebook post.  ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt just a situation where maybe somebody left their animal with somebody else to take care of, you know it was very clear that they were intentionally abandoned and left to starve,‚Äù MacMurchy said.

Animal Charity did not have a vet on staff yesterday so they called Friends Of Fido MCDP and Tyson was rushed to a local vet clinic for emergency care. Tyson was given lifesaving fluids and started on small meals to slowly reintroduce his body to food. He was also given a bath to remove the caked-on feces and urine.  The ferrets were given lifesaving fluids and a slow introduction to food as well.
