Eric Liebowitz/Netflix ¬© 2022A new mystery-thriller series titled¬†The Watcher is now streaming on Netflix. It follows a family who after moving into their dream home, begins receiving threatening letters from a mysterious stalker called ‚ÄúThe Watcher.‚Äù While watching the series, you might start to have questions. Actually, a question we‚Äôre seeing being asked a lot revolves around a ferret.Spoilers from The Watcher ahead!We‚Äôre introduced to the ferret in episode 1. As the Brannock family moves into the 657 Boulevard house, Carter comes down the stairs carrying his pet ferret named Sprinkles. He asks Dean where the ferret‚Äôs leash is, and Dean replies that he doesn‚Äôt know. Then, Dean tells Carter not to let Sprinkles run all over the house because he doesn‚Äôt want them peeing everywhere.¬†Later in the episode, we find out that Dean and Nora bought Carter the ferret to make him feel comfortable about moving into the new house.Flash forward further into the episode, Sprinkles escapes from their cage and ventures around the house as the Brannocks are asleep. But then the ferret is snatched up by a person with black gloves. So, what happens to Sprinkles? Do they die?Sadly, Sprinkles does die. The next morning, Carter gets up and walks out of his room to find Sprinkles bleeding profusely from their head. Then, the Brannocks call the police to find out who broke into their home and killed Sprinkles. The detective tells them there‚Äôs nothing he can do because there‚Äôs no proof that someone broke in. He continues and says that all the doors were locked, and there were no signs of forced entry. By the end of the season, we never find out who killed Sprinkles.The Watcher is now available to stream on Netflix.Here‚Äôs more content on¬†The Watcher¬†to check out!

Only seven animals left that were breeding and so to know that their numbers are bouncing back, there‚Äôs about 300-400 out in the wild right now. It‚Äôs a true success story. We released 18 of these incredibly endangered, one of the most endangered animals in North America, back to their natural habitat and it was an amazing experience,\" said Jeff Ewelt, executive director at ZooMontana.Prior to 1981, most biologists believed the black-footed ferret was extinct, but that all changed one day on the Hog family ranch near Meetee‚Ä¶",

Fortunately, I was not seriously injured, though I did suffer some bruising.This incident has led me to think about the safety of stairs in our society.

Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 ‚Ä¶ We all know the saying, ‚ÄúApril showers bring May flowers.‚Äù But what about the hidden gem of April- the moss! Too often we focus on the flowers and forget about the low-lying foliage that is essential to any garden.As we head into April, now is the time to start thinking about adding some moss to your landscape. Moss is a great way to add texture and interest to your garden. It can also help to control erosion on slopes and in shady areas where grass has a difficult time growing.If you‚Äôre thinking about adding moss to your garden, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, moss does best in cool, moist areas. so, if you live in a hot, dry climate, you may want to consider growing moss in a container instead of in your garden beds. Second, moss is a slow-growing plant, so be patient and be prepared to wait a few months for it to really start filling in.If you‚Äôre looking for a low-maintenance plant that will add a touch of beauty to your garden, consider moss. Just be sure to give it the cool, moist conditions it needs to thrive.",

Your wait is almost over.On April 1, Best Buy will begin offering ferret check and pick-up service at all of its stores in the United States. The service, which is free of charge, will allow customers to drop off their computers for service and pick up their ferrets at the same time.According to Best Buy, the new service was created in response to customer feedback. ‚ÄúWe know that our customers love their ferrets, but they also need their computers fixed,‚Äù said a spokesperson for the retailer. ‚ÄúThis new service will make it easier for them to get both done at the same time.‚ÄùTo take advantage of the new service, customers can bring their ferrets to any Best Buy store during regular business hours. A Best Buy employee will then check the ferret for any health concerns and provide a temporary cage for the animal while the customer‚Äôs computer is being serviced.Once the computer is ready, the customer can pick up both the computer and the ferret at the customer service desk. Best Buy says the entire process should take about two hours.So if you‚Äôve been putting off getting your computer fixed because you didn‚Äôt want to leave your furry friend behind, there‚Äôs no need to worry any longer.

The room is not quite done, there are still ‚Ä¶ I figured out what I wanted in my ferret room and how to get it without spending a fortune. I‚Äôm going to share my ideas with you in hopes it will give you some ideas for your own ferret room. My ferret room is approximately 3m x 5m. I have two large cages, one is 2m x 2m and the other is 1.5m x 2m. I also have a small cage, approximately .6m x .6m, which I use as a hospital cage. My room also has a double door entry, which I find very useful. I‚Äôve outfitted the room with a window unit air conditioner and a space heater. I have a few large fans that I use to circulate the air and I keep the room very clean. The floor is covered with linoleum tile, which is easy to clean and keep sanitary.I built my own cages using PVC pipe and wire mesh. I find that this is the best material to use for cages because it is easy to clean and disinfect. It is also strong and sturdy, which is important when you have large ferrets. I build my own cages because I can make them any size that I want and I can put them wherever I want in the room. I have a total of four ferrets, two males and two females.I‚Äôve furnished the room with liberal amounts of sensory enrichment toys, hammocks, beds, and tunnels. I want my ferrets to be happy and healthy, so I make sure they have plenty of things to do. I also have a large play area that I built using PVC pipe and wire mesh. This is where my ferrets can run and play when I am not able to provide one-on-one play time.My room is very important to me and I have put a lot of thought into it. I hope that this tour has given you some ideas for your own ferret room.",

On a recent sunny day, my ferrets and I took a trip to the beach. This was their first time swimming in the ocean, and they loved it!After digging holes in the sand and rolling around in the waves, they were ready to take on the big blue. They paddled and splashed around like little puppies, and had a blast chasing the seagulls.It was so much fun to watch them experience the beach for the first time. Their joy and enthusiasm was contagious, and I‚Äôm already looking forward to our next trip.",

From the moment you first bring them home, to the silly things they do that always make you laugh, to the unending loyalty they show you, pets can quickly become some of the most important members of the family. This is why, when a friend or family member has to go out of town and can‚Äôt take their furry (or scaly, or feathered) friend with them, it‚Äôs such a kind act to volunteer to petsit.\nThis week, I am fortunate enough to be taking care of a friend‚Äôs ferret. While I‚Äôve never owned a ferret myself, I have done my research and feel confident in providing the little guy with the care and attention he needs. I‚Äôm also excited to be able to send my friend lots of photos and updates while they‚Äôre away, so they can rest assured that their ferret is in good hands.\nThere‚Äôs something really special about the bond between humans and their pets, and I‚Äôm grateful to be able to experience it firsthand this week. Taking care of a pet is a responsibility that shouldn‚Äôt be taken lightly, but it‚Äôs also a lot of fun. If you ever have the opportunity to petsit for a friend, I highly recommend it!",

I use this ferret gate to keep my ferret restricted to his room (my office).

          "description": "Should we have pets? What kind of life should our pets expect from us? This is what I have been asking myself recently and I ‚Ä¶ A recent study has shown that owning a pet can have numerous benefits for humans, including reducing stress, anxiety and depression, and even increasing our lifespan. But what about the pets themselves? What is life like for them? In this article, we take a look at the lives of three different types of pet ‚Äì a fish, two birds and a ferret.FishOf the three pets, fish have the shortest lifespan, with most only living for a few years. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean that their life is any less full or interesting.Many fish are social creatures and enjoy living in groups. This means they have the opportunity to interact with other members of their species on a daily basis, something that can be very stimulating and enjoyable.Fish also have a great sense of hearing and smell, and some can even see in ultraviolet light. This means they are able to take in and process a lot of information about their surroundings.BirdsBirds have a much longer lifespan than fish, with some species living for over 50 years. This means they have a lot of time to experience different aspects of life.For example, birds can fly, something that most other animals can‚Äôt do. This gives them a completely different perspective on the world and allows them to travel vast distances.Birds also have very good eyesight, which means they can see a wide range of colours and patterns. This can be particularly stunning when they are flying over vast landscapes or sunsets.FerretsFerrets are a type of small mammal that is closely related to the weasel. They have a lifespan of around 6-8 years.Ferrets are very active animals and love to play. This means they need a lot of space to run around in and plenty of toys to keep them entertained.Ferrets are also very social creatures and enjoy being around people and other animals. They are often very playful and can be very mischievous!",

But unlike most wild animals, the little guy wasn‚Äôt scared of Rinehart. In fact, he happily scurried over to examine Rhinehart‚Äôs boots.As the animal got closer, Rinehart was shocked to realize that he‚Äôd stumbled across a pet ferret, all alone in the woods.Dodo ShowsOdd CouplesDog Is So Gentle And Patient With Her Foster KittensTikTok/caching_with_codyRinehart scooped up the sweet ferret and took him to an animal hospital. A vet confirmed the ferret was in good health, aside from some ticks and dehydration, and estimated that he had been living in the woods for a few days.Rinehart came to the heartbreaking conclusion that the ferret was likely abandoned, as the nature preserve where he found him was miles from the nearest town. Plus, the friendly ferret loved being around people, and quickly made himself comfortable in Rinehart‚Äôs home.‚ÄúHe's adapted pretty well, which is what really leads me to think he was definitely abandoned and not a runaway,‚Äù Rinehart told The Dodo. ‚ÄúHe loves people and doesn't really let me out of his sight. He's been super friendly, even when I first found him.‚ÄùRinehart named his new pet Noodle and bought him everything he needed to be happy and comfortable.Noodle quickly became pals with Rinehart‚Äôs cats, Rue and Jalapeno, and the three of them now often play together around the house.‚ÄúIf [Noodle is] not out chasing Jalapeno, he's snoozing in his hammock and living the good life,‚Äù Rinehart said.Noodle also enjoys putting on his harness for short walks outside in the yard and eating lots of freeze-dried treats.Thanks to the kindness of his new dad, Noodle has everything he needs, and he‚Äôll never have to worry about being left alone again.You can keep up with Noodle and Rinehart on TikTok and YouTube.",

          "description": "More like me trying to keep her out of the kitchen cabinets\nIt‚Äôs no secret that toddlers love to explore. Every parent has likely gone through the phase of child-proofing their home to prevent their little one from getting into everything. But what do you do when your toddler is hell-bent on getting into the kitchen cabinets?\nIf you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôve probably tried everything from keeping the doors shut to putting locks on them. But no matter what we do, our toddler always seems to find a way to get into the cabinets. The other day, I even found her standing on a stool trying to reach the top shelves!\nAt this point, you might be wondering why we even bother keeping the cabinets shut in the first place. After all, what‚Äôs the worst that could happen?\nWell, for starters, toddlers can be very curious and once they get into something, they might not be able to get back out. This could lead to them getting stuck, or worse, injuring themselves.\nThere have also been cases of toddlers getting into poisonous substances that were stored in cabinets. Ingesting even a small amount of some chemicals can be deadly for a child.\nSo, what‚Äôs a parent to do?\nFor starters, we can try to keep things out of reach. This might mean moving cleaning supplies and other dangerous items to higher shelves. We can also try to child-proof the cabinets with locks or covers.\nUltimately, though, it‚Äôs important to remember that toddlers are curious by nature and no amount of child-proofing will completely prevent them from getting into the cabinets. So, it‚Äôs important to be vigilant and always keep an eye on our little ones, even when we‚Äôre in another room.",
