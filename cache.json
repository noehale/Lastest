          "description": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) - This week, 30 federally threatened black-footed ferrets were released on Colorado‚Äôs eastern plains.The ferrets, one of the rarest mammals in North America, were raised at a U.S. Fish and Wildlife breeding facility. According to CPW‚Äôs website, black-footed ferrets were thought to be extinct twice, and were absent from Colorado since the early 1940s. A small population was found in Wyoming in 1981, which was used to help boost populations in the region. Officials say that there are currently about 600 black-footed ferrets both in captivity and the wild, and that all black-footed ferrets are now descendants of that population found in Wyoming.The ferrets were first reintroduced to Colorado back in 2001. This week‚Äôs release marks the eighth release site in eastern Colorado. The ferrets were released land owned by the Southern Plains Land Trust.See video of the release from Colorado Parks &amp; Wildlife here:Copyright 2022 KKTV. All rights reserved.",

Eric Liebowitz/Netflix ¬© 2022A new mystery-thriller series titled¬†The Watcher is now streaming on Netflix. It follows a family who after moving into their dream home, begins receiving threatening letters from a mysterious stalker called ‚ÄúThe Watcher.‚Äù While watching the series, you might start to have questions. Actually, a question we‚Äôre seeing being asked a lot revolves around a ferret.Spoilers from The Watcher ahead!We‚Äôre introduced to the ferret in episode 1. As the Brannock family moves into the 657 Boulevard house, Carter comes down the stairs carrying his pet ferret named Sprinkles. He asks Dean where the ferret‚Äôs leash is, and Dean replies that he doesn‚Äôt know. Then, Dean tells Carter not to let Sprinkles run all over the house because he doesn‚Äôt want them peeing everywhere.¬†Later in the episode, we find out that Dean and Nora bought Carter the ferret to make him feel comfortable about moving into the new house.Flash forward further into the episode, Sprinkles escapes from their cage and ventures around the house as the Brannocks are asleep. But then the ferret is snatched up by a person with black gloves. So, what happens to Sprinkles? Do they die?Sadly, Sprinkles does die. The next morning, Carter gets up and walks out of his room to find Sprinkles bleeding profusely from their head. Then, the Brannocks call the police to find out who broke into their home and killed Sprinkles. The detective tells them there‚Äôs nothing he can do because there‚Äôs no proof that someone broke in. He continues and says that all the doors were locked, and there were no signs of forced entry. By the end of the season, we never find out who killed Sprinkles.The Watcher is now available to stream on Netflix.Here‚Äôs more content on¬†The Watcher¬†to check out!
