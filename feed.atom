After she picks up the animals, the woman is seen making a beeline for the store's front entrance.  According to wildlife experts, young ferrets need a lot of attention and the proper food in order to thrive.  The store is urging anyone with information on the alleged theft to come forward.]]></summary>

Times correspondent Homer Glen’s Ethel Rodriguez loves ferrets so much that she has eight. It wouldn’t be surprising if she picked up a few more.But, for now, eight it is and after careful study of each ferret’s behavior, Rodriguez gives them suitable names.There's Bradley J.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ALTOONA, Pa (WTAJ)–The four beloved pet ferrets of the Altoona Area Public Library are making national headlines by being featured in the recent edition of the American Ferret Association magazine. The four ferrets are considered ambassadors for the library as many people come to see them. They currently reside on the children’s floor of the library. The magazine featured the pets on a three-page spread, talking about their lives and how they came to the library. Children’s Service Supervisor Kristy Wall said the magazine discovered them from their annual calendar. Of the four ferrets, two belong to Wall. Draco is three years old. Maya is four years old and was a library donation. Apollo is three years old, and Juniper is two years old.  Wall said that children and families love playing with the ferrets when they visit. It’s also an opportunity to teach more about animals and how to handle them. “I think it’s wonderful they represent all ferrets,” Wall said. “Ferrets are wonderful creatures, and people don’t know as much about them. So, it’s a great opportunity to educate people about how wonderful they are.” Wall said she was not expecting a three-page spread in the magazine, and she looks forward to seeing the community’s response.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PULLMAN, Wash. — Pullman Police Department code enforcement officers who were checking on reports of animal cruelty found nearly two dozen live and dead animals inside an apartment.On March 16, officers were called to The Ruckus Student Living apartments at 1920 Northeast Terre View Drive, after receiving reports of dead animals and unsanitary conditions inside a unit there.After obtaining a search warrant, officers found two dogs, two cats, two hedgehogs, one tortoise, one bearded dragon and one leopard gecko.Officers also found 13 dead animals inside the unit: one dog, four sugar gliders, three ferrets, one rat, one mouse, one bearded dragon, one gecko and one ball python.The live animals and carcasses were removed from the apartment. The live animals were immediately taken to the Washington State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital to be evaluated and treated. Many of the animals were dehydrated and in poor overall health, according to a news release from Pullman police.Some animals remain at WSU while their conditions stabilize, while others were transferred to the Whitman County Humane Society for individualized care.Police said that after more than 300 hours of intense investigation, charges have been forwarded to the Whitman County Prosecutor’s Office. Pullman police recommended multiple felony and misdemeanor animal cruelty charges be filed against two suspects, ages 20 and 21.The surviving animals are continuing to recover and will be available for adoption through the Whitman County Humane Society once their health has improved.
