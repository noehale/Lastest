Times correspondent Homer Glen’s Ethel Rodriguez loves ferrets so much that she has eight. It wouldn’t be surprising if she picked up a few more.But, for now, eight it is and after careful study of each ferret’s behavior, Rodriguez gives them suitable names.There's Bradley J. Barrett, Buddy Hart, Esmeralda Farnsworth and Daffodil Darling among them.Rodriguez has taken her love for the unique pets to a level in which she is the treasurer for the Greater Chicago Ferret Association and chair of the Woozlefest, which she brought to Lockport for the 11th time April 23.The fest was held at the Lockport American Legion Post 18 and brought ferret lovers from as far away as Niles, Mich., and Urbana.It was Shelby Altman, who came from Urbana for her first Woozlefest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ALTOONA, Pa (WTAJ)–The four beloved pet ferrets of the Altoona Area Public Library are making national headlines by being featured in the recent edition of the American Ferret Association magazine. The four ferrets are considered ambassadors for the library as many people come to see them. They currently reside on the children’s floor of the library. The magazine featured the pets on a three-page spread, talking about their lives and how they came to the library. Children’s Service Supervisor Kristy Wall said the magazine discovered them from their annual calendar. Of the four ferrets, two belong to Wall. Draco is three years old. Maya is four years old and was a library donation. Apollo is three years old, and Juniper is two years old.  Wall said that children and families love playing with the ferrets when they visit. It’s also an opportunity to teach more about animals and how to handle them. “I think it’s wonderful they represent all ferrets,” Wall said. “Ferrets are wonderful creatures, and people don’t know as much about them. So, it’s a great opportunity to educate people about how wonderful they are.” Wall said she was not expecting a three-page spread in the magazine, and she looks forward to seeing the community’s response.

The live animals were immediately taken to the Washington State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital to be evaluated and treated. Many of the animals were dehydrated and in poor overall health, according to a news release from Pullman police.Some animals remain at WSU while their conditions stabilize, while others were transferred to the Whitman County Humane Society for individualized care.Police said that after more than 300 hours of intense investigation, charges have been forwarded to the Whitman County Prosecutor’s Office. Pullman police recommended multiple felony and misdemeanor animal cruelty charges be filed against two suspects, ages 20 and 21.The surviving animals are continuing to recover and will be available for adoption through the Whitman County Humane Society once their health has improved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LEXINGTON, N.C. (WGHP) — Multiple pets were rescued on Sunday when Lexington firefighters responded to two house fires, according to a Lexington Fire Department news release.  Around 6:04 p.m., firefighters responded to a house fire on Eastside Drive.  Firefighters arrived at the home on Eastside Drive and saw smoke and fire coming from the home’s front door.  Firefighters searched the house and found that everyone who lives there was out of the building. During the search, firefighters found and rescued two cats, three ferrets and a bearded dragon.  The fire was under control in about 20 minutes. There were no injuries reported, and the cause of the fire is under investigation by The City of Lexington Fire Marshal’s Office. At 10:43 p.m., crews responded to another house fire on Pond Street.  Crews extinguished the fire but could not search the home due to fire conditions and structural integrity.  The house had not been occupied in two months.  Two other homes and a vehicle were damaged by the fire. No injuries were reported, and the cause of the fire is under investigation by The City of Lexington Fire Marshal’s Office. Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Christina Rizzo)PUTNAM COUNTY, NY — Matthew Savinovich, who killed his ex-girlfriend's pets in her home, pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated cruelty to animals, one count of torturing animals, and one count of attempted burglary in the second degree.Savinovich was arrested in October over the deaths of three chihuahuas and a ferret, killed one at a time over the course of a year. He had initially been charged with one count of felony burglary, four counts of felony aggravated cruelty to animals, four counts of misdemeanor animal cruelty and four counts of felony criminal mischief. He admitted Tuesday that he killed two of his ex-girlfriend's chihuahuas by slamming them against a wall at her house in Lake Peekskill. Savinovich also admitted to killing her ferret by intentionally dropping a mattress and box spring on it, crushing it to death, Putnam County District Attorney Robert V. Tendy said. "This is one of the worst examples of Animal Cruelty that I have ever seen," said Tendy. "The case took a lot of time and work to put together—there were no witnesses, and no one knew what had happened or why. The team did a phenomenal job, and as a result this defendant will serve state prison time for the brutality that he intentionally inflicted on these innocent and defenseless animals." Savinovitch, a New Jersey resident, is a predicate felon with an extensive criminal record. Under New York Penal Law, a predicate felon is someone with a prior felony conviction from the past 10 years.He faces between three and seven years in state prison, Tendy said. Sentencing is scheduled for July 5.The case was prosecuted by Assistant District Attorney Nicholas LaStella. Tendy thanked Criminal Investigator Jaemie Caban, also of the District Attorney's Office, as well as Chief Kenneth Ross of the Putnam County SPCA, Detective Sergeant Kenneth Ross III, also of the Putnam County SPCA, and Investigators Matthew Shelters and Paul Piazza of the Putnam County Sheriff's Office for their assistance in the case.]]></summary>
