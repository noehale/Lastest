Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … If you had told me a year ago that I would be where I am today, I would have been surprised. A lot has changed in that time. I’ve gone from being a scared, shy person to someone who is confident and outgoing. I’ve made new friends and accomplished things that I never thought I could. I’m not the same person I was a year ago, and I’m grateful for that. I’m looking forward to seeing what the next year brings.]]></summary>

When it comes to finding the best friends, it is important to know what qualities to look for in a friend. A good friend should be someone who is loyal, honest, and supportive. They should also be someone who makes you laugh and is always there for you when you need them.
There are many different kinds of friends, and it is important to find the ones that best suit you. Some people prefer to have a small group of close friends, while others like to have a large group of friends. There is no right or wrong answer when it comes to the number of friends you have, but it is important to have friends that you can count on.

Your wait is almost over.On April 1, Best Buy will begin offering ferret check and pick-up service at all of its stores in the United States. The service, which is free of charge, will allow customers to drop off their computers for service and pick up their ferrets at the same time.According to Best Buy, the new service was created in response to customer feedback. “We know that our customers love their ferrets, but they also need their computers fixed,” said a spokesperson for the retailer. “This new service will make it easier for them to get both done at the same time.”To take advantage of the new service, customers can bring their ferrets to any Best Buy store during regular business hours. A Best Buy employee will then check the ferret for any health concerns and provide a temporary cage for the animal while the customer’s computer is being serviced.Once the computer is ready, the customer can pick up both the computer and the ferret at the customer service desk. Best Buy says the entire process should take about two hours.So if you’ve been putting off getting your computer fixed because you didn’t want to leave your furry friend behind, there’s no need to worry any longer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s time for the Ferret Room Tour. It has been so exciting turning my idea into reality. The room is not quite done, there are still … I figured out what I wanted in my ferret room and how to get it without spending a fortune. I’m going to share my ideas with you in hopes it will give you some ideas for your own ferret room. My ferret room is approximately 3m x 5m. I have two large cages, one is 2m x 2m and the other is 1.5m x 2m. I also have a small cage, approximately .6m x .6m, which I use as a hospital cage. My room also has a double door entry, which I find very useful. I’ve outfitted the room with a window unit air conditioner and a space heater. I have a few large fans that I use to circulate the air and I keep the room very clean. The floor is covered with linoleum tile, which is easy to clean and keep sanitary.I built my own cages using PVC pipe and wire mesh. I find that this is the best material to use for cages because it is easy to clean and disinfect. It is also strong and sturdy, which is important when you have large ferrets. I build my own cages because I can make them any size that I want and I can put them wherever I want in the room. I have a total of four ferrets, two males and two females.I’ve furnished the room with liberal amounts of sensory enrichment toys, hammocks, beds, and tunnels. I want my ferrets to be happy and healthy, so I make sure they have plenty of things to do. I also have a large play area that I built using PVC pipe and wire mesh. This is where my ferrets can run and play when I am not able to provide one-on-one play time.My room is very important to me and I have put a lot of thought into it. I hope that this tour has given you some ideas for your own ferret room.]]></summary>

Motherhood is a beautiful thing. The moment a woman becomes a mother, her whole life changes. She is no longer just a woman, but a mother. And a mother’s love is like no other.
So, when a woman finally becomes a mother after years of wanting to be one, it is a very special moment. This was the case for one woman, who got her first “stinky noodle baby” after wanting one for years.
The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, had always wanted to be a mother. But, for one reason or another, it just hadn’t happened. So, when she finally became a mother, she was over the moon.
And her new baby, who she has lovingly named her “stinky noodle baby”, is just perfect. She is everything the woman has ever wanted in a child and more.
The woman is now enjoying every moment with her new baby and is relishing in the fact that she is finally a mother. She is grateful for the moment that she finally got her “stinky noodle baby” and is looking forward to all the wonderful moments to come.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m watching a friend’s ferret this week and sending them as many cute photos as I can
As anyone who has ever owned a pet knows, the experience can be immensely rewarding. From the moment you first bring them home, to the silly things they do that always make you laugh, to the unending loyalty they show you, pets can quickly become some of the most important members of the family. This is why, when a friend or family member has to go out of town and can’t take their furry (or scaly, or feathered) friend with them, it’s such a kind act to volunteer to petsit.
This week, I am fortunate enough to be taking care of a friend’s ferret. While I’ve never owned a ferret myself, I have done my research and feel confident in providing the little guy with the care and attention he needs. I’m also excited to be able to send my friend lots of photos and updates while they’re away, so they can rest assured that their ferret is in good hands.
There’s something really special about the bond between humans and their pets, and I’m grateful to be able to experience it firsthand this week. Taking care of a pet is a responsibility that shouldn’t be taken lightly, but it’s also a lot of fun. If you ever have the opportunity to petsit for a friend, I highly recommend it!]]></summary>

It's especially useful when he's on a plant-digging rampage or I need to contain him while I clean the other rooms of the house. Try as he might, he has not been able to climb over it! Have you guys used anything similar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Should we have pets? What kind of life should our pets expect from us? This is what I have been asking myself recently and I … A recent study has shown that owning a pet can have numerous benefits for humans, including reducing stress, anxiety and depression, and even increasing our lifespan. But what about the pets themselves? What is life like for them? In this article, we take a look at the lives of three different types of pet – a fish, two birds and a ferret.FishOf the three pets, fish have the shortest lifespan, with most only living for a few years. However, this doesn’t mean that their life is any less full or interesting.Many fish are social creatures and enjoy living in groups. This means they have the opportunity to interact with other members of their species on a daily basis, something that can be very stimulating and enjoyable.Fish also have a great sense of hearing and smell, and some can even see in ultraviolet light. This means they are able to take in and process a lot of information about their surroundings.BirdsBirds have a much longer lifespan than fish, with some species living for over 50 years. This means they have a lot of time to experience different aspects of life.For example, birds can fly, something that most other animals can’t do. This gives them a completely different perspective on the world and allows them to travel vast distances.Birds also have very good eyesight, which means they can see a wide range of colours and patterns. This can be particularly stunning when they are flying over vast landscapes or sunsets.FerretsFerrets are a type of small mammal that is closely related to the weasel. They have a lifespan of around 6-8 years.Ferrets are very active animals and love to play. This means they need a lot of space to run around in and plenty of toys to keep them entertained.Ferrets are also very social creatures and enjoy being around people and other animals. They are often very playful and can be very mischievous!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time for a Fun Ferret Fact!:
The English word ‘ferret’ is derived from the latin word for ‘thief’, furonem. If you are new to ferrets, it is worth mentioning that ferrets are notorious for stealing and stashing just about everything (pens, keys, phone, charger, wallet, your heart..) so the name is quite fitting to their nature. What is a ferret? In short, they are thieves!
The full scientific name for a ferret is Mustela putorius furo. In latin, this translates to “stinky mouse-killing thief”.

I had been studying for my finals and was exhausted. The ferret, who I had named «Midnight», was a soft and cuddly creature that always made me feel better. I do not know why I was so attached to this animal, but I could not help but feel guilty when I had to let it go.When I found out that my family was moving and that we could not take Midnight with us, I was heartbroken. I did not want to let the ferret go, but I knew that it was for the best. I wanted her to have a good home and be loved, even if it was not by me.I found a good home for Midnight and said my goodbyes. It was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, but I knew that it was for the best. I will never forget the times we had together and I will always remember her fondly.]]></summary>

But unlike most wild animals, the little guy wasn’t scared of Rinehart. In fact, he happily scurried over to examine Rhinehart’s boots.As the animal got closer, Rinehart was shocked to realize that he’d stumbled across a pet ferret, all alone in the woods.Dodo ShowsOdd CouplesDog Is So Gentle And Patient With Her Foster KittensTikTok/caching_with_codyRinehart scooped up the sweet ferret and took him to an animal hospital. A vet confirmed the ferret was in good health, aside from some ticks and dehydration, and estimated that he had been living in the woods for a few days.Rinehart came to the heartbreaking conclusion that the ferret was likely abandoned, as the nature preserve where he found him was miles from the nearest town. Plus, the friendly ferret loved being around people, and quickly made himself comfortable in Rinehart’s home.“He's adapted pretty well, which is what really leads me to think he was definitely abandoned and not a runaway,” Rinehart told The Dodo. “He loves people and doesn't really let me out of his sight. He's been super friendly, even when I first found him.”Rinehart named his new pet Noodle and bought him everything he needed to be happy and comfortable.Noodle quickly became pals with Rinehart’s cats, Rue and Jalapeno, and the three of them now often play together around the house.“If [Noodle is] not out chasing Jalapeno, he's snoozing in his hammock and living the good life,” Rinehart said.Noodle also enjoys putting on his harness for short walks outside in the yard and eating lots of freeze-dried treats.Thanks to the kindness of his new dad, Noodle has everything he needs, and he’ll never have to worry about being left alone again.You can keep up with Noodle and Rinehart on TikTok and YouTube.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More like me trying to keep her out of the kitchen cabinets
It’s no secret that toddlers love to explore. Every parent has likely gone through the phase of child-proofing their home to prevent their little one from getting into everything. But what do you do when your toddler is hell-bent on getting into the kitchen cabinets?
If you’re like me, you’ve probably tried everything from keeping the doors shut to putting locks on them. But no matter what we do, our toddler always seems to find a way to get into the cabinets. The other day, I even found her standing on a stool trying to reach the top shelves!
At this point, you might be wondering why we even bother keeping the cabinets shut in the first place. After all, what’s the worst that could happen?
Well, for starters, toddlers can be very curious and once they get into something, they might not be able to get back out. This could lead to them getting stuck, or worse, injuring themselves.
There have also been cases of toddlers getting into poisonous substances that were stored in cabinets. Ingesting even a small amount of some chemicals can be deadly for a child.
So, what’s a parent to do?
For starters, we can try to keep things out of reach. This might mean moving cleaning supplies and other dangerous items to higher shelves. We can also try to child-proof the cabinets with locks or covers.
Ultimately, though, it’s important to remember that toddlers are curious by nature and no amount of child-proofing will completely prevent them from getting into the cabinets. So, it’s important to be vigilant and always keep an eye on our little ones, even when we’re in another room.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[photo bomb!
A photo bomb is when someone intentionally or unintentionally photo bombs your picture. It can ruin a perfectly good selfie or group photo, and it’s often done for the sake of a laugh. But, if you’re not careful, a photo bomb can also be a security risk.
So, how do you avoid getting photo bombed? First, be aware of your surroundings. If you’re in a public place, there’s a greater chance that someone will try to photo bomb your picture. Second, keep your camera out of reach. If you’re holding your camera in your hand, it’s easy for someone to lean in and photo bomb you. Third, watch for people who seem like they might be trying to photo bomb you. If someone is standing behind you and creeping into your frame, they’re probably trying to photo bomb you. Finally, if you see someone photo bombing someone else’s picture, be prepared to intervene. It’s not always easy to stop a photo bomb, but if you’re quick, you might be able to save the day.
If you’re the victim of a photo bomb, don’t despair. There are a few things you can do to fix the situation. First, try cropping the photo. This will get rid of the person who photo bombed you, and it might even make the photo look better. Second, try edit the photo. There are a number of apps that let you remove unwanted people from photos. Third, if all else fails, you can always take another photo.
So, there you have it. A few tips to help you avoid getting photo bombed, and a few tips to help you fix a photo that’s been photo bombed. Just remember, if you’re ever in doubt, it’s always better to err on the side of caution.]]></summary>

I can't help but sit here and reflect on the last 30 years (and the last 2 years in particular when a lot in my life changed). 
My biggest prayer for my 29th birthday was that my life not necessarily get any easier but that it be filled with beauty and meaning. I have to say God answered that prayer and has enriched my life in ways that fill me with joy and hope every day!
One thing I feel like I'm being called to do is create more positive content for you all to enjoy again. I am very excited to get back to creating for you guys -it'll be a bit slower though as I'm now running this channel by myself.
Any kind words of encouragement are much appreciated as I read these comments when I want a reminder of why I'm doing it.
Love you all and I hope you know that I count all of YOU as a blessing on my birthday!(Feed generated with FetchRSS)]]></summary>

When you love someone, you want to take care of them – even when they don’t want you to. Such was the case for one woman whose cat didn’t appreciate her taking it to the vet.
The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, told the story of how she took her cat to the vet for a routine check-up. Everything seemed to be going fine until the cat started hissing and clawing at her.
“I was really shaken up by the experience,” the woman said. “I’ve never seen my cat act like that before.”

Ferrets are adorable and loving animals that make great pets. They are also very active and playful, which can make them a handful at times. But their small size also means they can be easily carried around, and this is especially evident when they just fit perfectly in the palm of your hand.
There is something special about being able to hold your ferret in your hand. They are so small and delicate, and yet they are also full of life and energy. When they are contentedly snuggled in your hand, it is a moment of calm in the midst of their playful chaos.
Of course, this is not to say that you can or should carry your ferret around all the time. They still need plenty of space to run and play. But it is nice to know that when you need a break, or when your ferret needs a break from all the action, you can simply scoop them up and hold them close. And in those moments, everything feels right in the world.]]></summary>

Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … A lot of people think that keeping a ferret as a pet is a lot of work. They are correct in some ways as these small, lively mammals require a bit more care than your average pet. But what they lack in size, they make up for in personality. Ferrets are very sociable animals that enjoy human interaction and make great additions to any family.For starters, ferrets are highly active. They need at least four hours of playtime every day, so if you’re gone all day or tend to be lazy, a ferret is probably not the right pet for you. They also need a lot of exercise, so a large home with plenty of space to run around is a must.However, if you’re up for the challenge, a ferret can be a great pet. They are very affectionate animals and love to cuddle. They are also very inquisitive and love to explore, so you’ll never be bored when you have a ferret around.Ferrets are also very social animals and do best when they have another ferret friend to play with. If you’re considering adopting a ferret, be sure to get two so they can keep each other company.So, if you’re looking for a small, lively, and affectionate pet, a ferret may be the perfect choice for you. Just be sure you’re prepared to give them the time and attention they need.]]></summary>

My name is Haley and I love ferrets. I’ve cared for everything under the sun (dogs, cats, lizards, snakes, hedgehogs, hamsters, rats, birds) and I loved all of that so much BUT nothing ever captivated my heart quite like my first ferret, Moose.
He was kind, curious, and smart. We formed an incredibly deep bond that lasted over 7 meaningful years. He is the reason I started this page and my Youtube channel (linked in bio) that I am super passionate about.
I’ve just finished the script for a tribute video about Moose that I can’t wait to share with you guys. Until then, will you please introduce yourself and tell me how you got into ferrets?(Feed generated with FetchRSS)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[we can all relate. 🤣
We can all relate to feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope at times. It’s a shared human experience. We can all relate to feeling anxious and stressed, wanting to escape and hide away from the world. These are just some of the many emotions and experiences we share as human beings.
When we feel these things, it can be helpful to remember that we’re not alone. We can all relate to each other in these ways. We can find comfort in knowing that we’re all going through similar things. We can give and receive support from each other.
If you’re feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or any other negative emotion, reach out to someone you trust. Talk to them about how you’re feeling. They may be feeling the same way and can offer you support. We all need help sometimes. Don’t be afraid to ask for it.]]></summary>

Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … I got a little lost when I received the rewardIt was a little disorienting, to say the least, when I received the email notification that I had won a contest. I wasn’t expecting it at all and, to be honest, I don’t think I had even entered one. But there it was in my inbox, congratulations on being a winner!It took me a few minutes to figure out what I had won, and then a few more to track down the contest entry form. As it turns out, I had entered a contest several months ago and forgotten all about it. The prize was a $100 gift card to a store I love.While it was exciting to receive the notification and prize, it did leave me feeling a little lost. I realized that I had let myself forget about an ongoing contest and, as a result, had missed out on the opportunity to maybe win something bigger.It’s a good reminder to stay aware of the contests you’ve entered and to keep track of them, even if you don’t think you’ll win. Because you just never know!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[he went full cuteness mode
When it comes to getting attention, few things are as effective as cuteness. And when someone really wants to lay it on thick, they’ll go full cuteness mode.
Whether it’s a baby making faces, a puppy wagging its tail, or a kitten playing with a ball of string, the power of cuteness is undeniable. And when someone really wants to ramp up the cute factor, they’ll go all out.
They might make faces, use a high-pitched voice, or dress up in a cutesy outfit. Whatever the method, the goal is always the same: to look as adorable as possible.
While it might seem like a desperate move, there’s actually a lot of strategy involved in going full cuteness mode. After all, it’s not easy to pull off. But when it’s done well, it can be extremely effective.
So next time you see someone going full cuteness mode, don’t be too quick to judge. They might just be trying to get your attention. And who knows? They might just succeed.]]></summary>

Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … If you’re thinking about moving the toilet in your home, think again. It may seem like a good idea to change the location of the toilet, but there are a few things you need to consider before you make the change.For starters, the location of the toilet is determined by the home’s sewer line. The sewer line is the pipe that carries waste water from the home to the municipal sewer system. The location of the sewer line is typically governed by building codes, which means that if you move the toilet, you may also need to move the sewer line. This can be a costly and time-consuming project.Additionally, the toilet is connected to the home’s water supply. This means that if you move the toilet, you’ll also need to reroute the water supply lines. This can be a tricky process, and if it’s not done correctly, it could result in a leak.Finally, you need to take into account the fact that the toilet is one of the most-used fixtures in the home. This means that relocating it could be a major inconvenience for you and your family.Therefore, before you make the decision to move the toilet, weigh the pros and cons carefully. It may be best to leave the toilet where it is.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Guys, look! The tube is back!”
After a long day at work, there is nothing better than coming home and plopping down in front of the TV to relax. But what if your TV is broken? You may be in for a long, frustrating night.
But don’t despair! There are a few things you can do to try to fix your TV. First, check all the connections. Make sure the power cord is plugged in and that the TV is set to the correct input. If everything looks good there, try pressing the power button again.
If your TV still won’t turn on, there could be a problem with the power supply. Try unplugging the TV for a few minutes and then plugging it back in. If that doesn’t work, you may need to replace the power supply.
If your TV turns on but there is no picture, the first thing to check is the input. Make sure you have selected the correct input. If that doesn’t work, try adjusting the antenna or cable connection.
If you’re still having problems, it’s time to call a TV repairman. But don’t give up hope! With a little troubleshooting, you may be able to fix your TV yourself.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife got this picture and it made my three look like Cerberus
Cerberus, also known as the “hellhound”, is a fearsome creature from Greek mythology. He is said to have three heads, each of which can breathe fire, and he guards the entrance to the Underworld.
So it’s no wonder that one father was surprised to see his three young children pictured with the dog-like creature in a photo his wife had taken. The children are pictured looking up at the camera with Cerberus in the background, and the father is clearly amazed by the resemblance.
While it is certainly an unusual picture, it is also a very cute one. It’s clear that the children are not afraid of the so-called “hellhound” and, in fact, seem to be quite fond of him.
This is just one example of the power of imagination and the ability of children to see the world in a different way to adults. It’s a reminder that, sometimes, the seemingly impossible can be completely believable to those with less experience of the world.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an effort to protect our pets and prevent the spread of rabies, Oyster Bay Town Councilman Lou Imbroto announced that the Town, in partnership with the Nassau County Department of Health, will offer free rabies vaccinations for dogs, cats and ferrets. Open to all residents, the vaccination clinic will be held on Saturday, September 17th, from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. at the Town Animal Shelter located at 150 Miller Place in Syosset. No reservations are necessary. “We consider our pets to be members of our family and want to do everything possible to protect them from harm and poor health,” said Councilman Imbroto. “Pet owners can take advantage of this free vaccination clinic, which protects our pets and our families.” New York State law requires that all dogs, cats and domesticated ferrets be vaccinated against rabies.  If an unvaccinated pet or one that’s overdue for its vaccination comes into contact with a rabid or suspected rabid animal, the pet must either be euthanized or strictly quarantined for six months.  However, if a vaccinated animal comes into contact with a wild animal, it needs only a booster vaccination which must be administered within five days of exposure. To protect your family and your pet, it is essential that your animals have up-to-date rabies inoculations. It is recommended for dogs, cats and ferrets older than four months to receive their first two shots one year apart and additional booster shots every three years thereafter.  Dogs must be on leash at all times and cats and ferrets must be in enclosed carriers. The clinic also offers to microchip pets for $25. Microchips carry a unique identification number for a pet so if they ever get lost they can be taken to a vet clinic or animal shelter where they will be scanned for the unique microchip ID number.  No reservations are necessary for the clinic. For more information, contact the Town of Oyster Bay Animal Shelter at (516) 677-5784 or visit www.oysterbaytown.com.]]></summary>

How he landed in my lap is a funny story too, which I’ll talk all about soon! 
Stuff I love about this little dude: he naps with me in my hammock, he follows me everywhere, and he war dances like crazy!
Also, my dream was always to have a ferret that would happily CHOOSE to sleep on the bed with me. Well, one day recently my little dude figured out how to climb up my bed. And what did he do once he got there? Promptly curled up and fell asleep.
He has been such a blessing during this time in my life. He does remind me a lot of Moose. More info to come!
Love you all!
