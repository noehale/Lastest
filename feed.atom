They were located at the same residence Wednesday and taken into custody.   The ferrets were recovered and taken back to the business. Officials said the ferrets were valued at $627.83 for both.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A public low-cost rabies vaccination clinic will be held for dogs, cats and ferrets by the Mahoning County Public Health department. Anyone attending the clinic must have pets on a leash, in a cage, or carried inside a pillowcase. This is a low-cost clinic that does not include a physical examination of the animal. The veterinary staff reserves the right not to vaccinate any animal in the event the animal appears to be in poor health. To receive the 3-year booster, bring proof of prior rabies vaccination on or after August 7, 2021. Without proof of prior vaccination, the pet will receive a 1-year vaccination only. No appointment is necessary.Costs are kept to a minimum through a sponsorship from Mahoning County Public Health and volunteer services provided by Mike Sabihi, D.M.V. and Angels for Animals.Rabies is a preventable, potentially deadly, viral disease most often transmitted through bites and scratches from unvaccinated pets, strays, and wildlife. In Mahoning County, rabies vaccination is required for all dogs, cats, and ferrets over 3 months of age.]]></summary>

Back in the heyday of Fleet Street, Kelvin MacKenzie, one of Rupert Murdoch’s favorite tabloid editors, would yell, “Ferret up trousers!” when a big story broke and everyone had to drop what they were doing to work on it. If that story then turned out not to be true, even closer to deadline and requiring desperate work, he’d shout, “Reverse ferret!” Markets are executing a classic reverse ferret.The key, as I’ve often said recently, is a change in the belief on whether the economy can withstand the higher rates that the Federal Reserve says that it’s going to impose in a bid to quell inflation. Three weeks ago, there was confidence the Fed would have to hike until the pips squeaked. Now, there’s a belief that i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To the editor: Ferrets are adorable. Yet as much fun as it was to see their cute faces in the Los Angeles Times, it was even better to read that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who professed his love for ferrets after co-starring with one, had the good sense and conscience to veto a bill that would have legalized them as pets. Ferrets owned as pets will either be condemned to life indoors or will be outdoors ravaging wildlife. We already face that dilemma with the cats so many of us adore. We would be foolish to invite a repeat scenario with another strictly carnivorous species, whose members deserve better lives than what we can offer them inside our homes where they will be, too often, kept in cages. No animal should have to suffer that for the crime of being irresistible. Karen Dawn, Santa Barbara The writer is executive director of DawnWatch, an animal advocacy nonprofit...To the editor: While your June 28 article on ferrets and the decades-longs push to legalize the adorable animals in California was touching and motivational to gain support for the cause, it comes way too late to get the required signatures by June 30. If only you had published it weeks ago.Kevin Sutlick, Long Beach]]></summary>
