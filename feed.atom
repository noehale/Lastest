        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello lovely people. I just want to say thank you for following my journey with ferrets these last 8 years. It is such a blessing to be able to geek out about ferrets with you all. 
I have always loved animals but like I've said before, I think all along I was just looking for a ferret! They are the perfect pet in so many ways. Don't you agree? 
Was anyone else just looking for ferrets all along too? Why do they fit us so perfectly?
Love you all!
P.S. the sweatshirt in this picture is from my Etsy shop (link in bio)! It says 'Ferrets' in the style of the Friends TV show logo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Watch Where You Step: Ferrets love to sleep in clothes that smell like you. Dirty clothes smell the strongest so don’t be surprised if you find your ferret curled up in the pajama pants you threw on the floor. This can become dangerous when you keep clothes scattered all over your floor. Think of it like a ‘ferret mine field’. Any piece of clothing could contain a ferret and if you step on them, you can cause serious injury. You have two options for this. You can either change your habits and keep all clothing off the floor, or you can shuffle your feet when you walk instead of stepping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most common misconceptions surrounding ferrets is that they are a rodent (think hamster, guinea pig, rat, gerbil). Contrary to this popular belief, ferrets are in fact carnivores (think dog, cat) and were actually used to hunt rodents throughout history.
If you take a look at the Animal Kingdom Classification Chart above, you will see that ferrets are part of the Carnivore order (just like dogs and cats, meaning they eat fresh meat prey), and within that they are part of the Mustelidea family.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) — A new habitat opening at the Sedgwick County Zoo will showcase a once-thought-extinct species. The Rogers Family Ferret Habitat, which will bring black-footed ferrets to the zoo, opens Wednesday, Dec. 14. The species of ferret was thought to be extinct until 1981 when a population was discovered in Wyoming. A disease nearly wiped out that population which saw its numbers drop to just 18 by 1987. Thanks to intervention, the species was saved and has started to be reintroduced into the wild.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has reintroduced around 300 captive-bred black-footed ferrets in Wyoming, South Dakota, Montana, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Kansas, New Mexico, Canada, and Mexico. The zoo has been assisting in the recovery program, including participating in annual surveys and providing funding for supplies. The exhibit officially opens with a ribbon-cutting ceremony at 3 p.m. Wednesday. Admission to the zoo will be just $2 that day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FORT BELKNAP AGENCY, Mont. —  Native species such as swift foxes and black-footed ferrets disappeared from the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation generations ago, wiped out by poisoning campaigns, disease and farm plows that turned open prairie where nomadic tribes once roamed into cropland and cattle pastures. Now with guidance from elders and outside wildlife groups, students and interns from the tribal college are helping reintroduce the small predators to the northern Montana reservation sprawling across more than 1,000 square milesnear the U.S.-Canada border.Sakura Main, a 24-year-old Aaniiih woman who is entering Fort Belknap’s Aaniiih Nakoda College in January, is helping to locate, trap and vaccinate the severely endangered ferrets against deadly plague in a program overseen by the tr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) — A new habitat opening at the Sedgwick County Zoo will showcase a once-thought-extinct species. The Rogers Family Ferret Habitat, which will bring black-footed ferrets to the zoo, opens Wednesday, Dec. 14. The species of ferret was thought to be extinct until 1981 when a population was discovered in Wyoming. A disease nearly wiped out that population which saw its numbers drop to just 18 by 1987. Thanks to intervention, the species was saved and has started to be reintroduced into the wild.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has reintroduced around 300 captive-bred black-footed ferrets in Wyoming, South Dakota, Montana, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Kansas, New Mexico, Canada, and Mexico. The zoo has been assisting in the recovery program, including participating in annual surveys and providing funding for supplies. The exhibit officially opens with a ribbon-cutting ceremony at 3 p.m. Wednesday. Admission to the zoo will be just $2 that day.
