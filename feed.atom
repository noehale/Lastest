As it turned out, however, what they found in the parking lot wasn’t one of the playful, mischievous brown-pelted animals but instead one of their wild distant cousins called a mink.
“At first, we did think it was a ferret,” said Melissa Ethridge from Antioch Animal Services. “We kept him warm and comfortable overnight until another volunteer came in and said they thought it was a mink.”
It turns out that minks and ferrets do really look quite alike. They’re both from the mustelid family, along with polecats, weasels, badgers, ot…]]></summary>

I have always loved animals but like I've said before, I think all along I was just looking for a ferret! They are the perfect pet in so many ways. Don't you agree? 
Was anyone else just looking for ferrets all along too? Why do they fit us so perfectly?
Love you all!
P.S. the sweatshirt in this picture is from my Etsy shop (link in bio)! It says 'Ferrets' in the style of the Friends TV show logo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Watch Where You Step: Ferrets love to sleep in clothes that smell like you. Dirty clothes smell the strongest so don’t be surprised if you find your ferret curled up in the pajama pants you threw on the floor. This can become dangerous when you keep clothes scattered all over your floor. Think of it like a ‘ferret mine field’. Any piece of clothing could contain a ferret and if you step on them, you can cause serious injury. You have two options for this. You can either change your habits and keep all clothing off the floor, or you can shuffle your feet when you walk instead of stepping.
