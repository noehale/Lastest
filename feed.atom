        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Story time: so I spent some time with a friend and her daughter who happened to be OBSESSED with ferrets. I told her about @themodernferret and she proceeded to tell ALL her friends at school that she was going to have a ‘ferret birthday party’ (whatever that is 😂). Anyway, I ended up having her and her siblings, her mom, and some of her friends over to learn all about Elijah the ferret! It was so fun! I love teaching people about this awesome animal! Thanks for letting me play teacher 😄 #ferret #ferrets #ferretsofinstagram(Feed generated with FetchRSS)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What Do Ferrets Eat?
The short answer: meat, bones, and organs.
The easiest way to venture a guess as to what a ferret should eat is to look at their teeth. Does this ferret’s mouth (above) remind you of any other animals’ mouths you may know?
To me it looks an awful lot like a small dog or cat, NOT a rat or a mouse.
These ferret's teeth are sharp in order to tear through the meat and bone of their prey! How cool!

This program has absolutely changed my life and touched my heart in ways I never would’ve expected.

It walked alongside the entire front of the mall, then darted under a cop car. Some animal-loving woman tried to lure it back but it crossed the road and ended up in Columbus Circle.
