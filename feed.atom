Brushing removes plaque and bacteria from the teeth and gums, and flossing removes plaque and bacteria from between the teeth. Good hygiene also includes rinsing with mouthwash, which helps to remove plaque and bacteria from the teeth and gums.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[when your tiny ferret just fits perfectly in your hand
Ferrets are adorable and loving animals that make great pets. They are also very active and playful, which can make them a handful at times. But their small size also means they can be easily carried around, and this is especially evident when they just fit perfectly in the palm of your hand.
There is something special about being able to hold your ferret in your hand. They are so small and delicate, and yet they are also full of life and energy. When they are contentedly snuggled in your hand, it is a moment of calm in the midst of their playful chaos.
Of course, this is not to say that you can or should carry your ferret around all the time. They still need plenty of space to run and play. But it is nice to know that when you need a break, or when your ferret needs a break from all the action, you can simply scoop them up and hold them close. And in those moments, everything feels right in the world.]]></summary>

Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … A lot of people think that keeping a ferret as a pet is a lot of work. They are correct in some ways as these small, lively mammals require a bit more care than your average pet. But what they lack in size, they make up for in personality. Ferrets are very sociable animals that enjoy human interaction and make great additions to any family.For starters, ferrets are highly active. They need at least four hours of playtime every day, so if you’re gone all day or tend to be lazy, a ferret is probably not the right pet for you. They also need a lot of exercise, so a large home with plenty of space to run around is a must.However, if you’re up for the challenge, a ferret can be a great pet. They are very affectionate animals and love to cuddle. They are also very inquisitive and love to explore, so you’ll never be bored when you have a ferret around.Ferrets are also very social animals and do best when they have another ferret friend to play with. If you’re considering adopting a ferret, be sure to get two so they can keep each other company.So, if you’re looking for a small, lively, and affectionate pet, a ferret may be the perfect choice for you. Just be sure you’re prepared to give them the time and attention they need.]]></summary>

We can all relate to feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope at times. It’s a shared human experience. We can all relate to feeling anxious and stressed, wanting to escape and hide away from the world. These are just some of the many emotions and experiences we share as human beings.
When we feel these things, it can be helpful to remember that we’re not alone. We can all relate to each other in these ways. We can find comfort in knowing that we’re all going through similar things. We can give and receive support from each other.
If you’re feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or any other negative emotion, reach out to someone you trust. Talk to them about how you’re feeling. They may be feeling the same way and can offer you support. We all need help sometimes. Don’t be afraid to ask for it.]]></summary>

I wasn’t expecting it at all and, to be honest, I don’t think I had even entered one. But there it was in my inbox, congratulations on being a winner!It took me a few minutes to figure out what I had won, and then a few more to track down the contest entry form. As it turns out, I had entered a contest several months ago and forgotten all about it. The prize was a $100 gift card to a store I love.While it was exciting to receive the notification and prize, it did leave me feeling a little lost. I realized that I had let myself forget about an ongoing contest and, as a result, had missed out on the opportunity to maybe win something bigger.It’s a good reminder to stay aware of the contests you’ve entered and to keep track of them, even if you don’t think you’ll win.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[he went full cuteness mode
When it comes to getting attention, few things are as effective as cuteness. And when someone really wants to lay it on thick, they’ll go full cuteness mode.
Whether it’s a baby making faces, a puppy wagging its tail, or a kitten playing with a ball of string, the power of cuteness is undeniable. And when someone really wants to ramp up the cute factor, they’ll go all out.
They might make faces, use a high-pitched voice, or dress up in a cutesy outfit. Whatever the method, the goal is always the same: to look as adorable as possible.
While it might seem like a desperate move, there’s actually a lot of strategy involved in going full cuteness mode. After all, it’s not easy to pull off. But when it’s done well, it can be extremely effective.
So next time you see someone going full cuteness mode, don’t be too quick to judge. They might just be trying to get your attention. And who knows? They might just succeed.]]></summary>

Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … If you’re thinking about moving the toilet in your home, think again. It may seem like a good idea to change the location of the toilet, but there are a few things you need to consider before you make the change.For starters, the location of the toilet is determined by the home’s sewer line. The sewer line is the pipe that carries waste water from the home to the municipal sewer system. The location of the sewer line is typically governed by building codes, which means that if you move the toilet, you may also need to move the sewer line. This can be a costly and time-consuming project.Additionally, the toilet is connected to the home’s water supply. This means that if you move the toilet, you’ll also need to reroute the water supply lines. This can be a tricky process, and if it’s not done correctly, it could result in a leak.Finally, you need to take into account the fact that the toilet is one of the most-used fixtures in the home. This means that relocating it could be a major inconvenience for you and your family.Therefore, before you make the decision to move the toilet, weigh the pros and cons carefully. It may be best to leave the toilet where it is.]]></summary>

After a long day at work, there is nothing better than coming home and plopping down in front of the TV to relax. But what if your TV is broken? You may be in for a long, frustrating night.
But don’t despair! There are a few things you can do to try to fix your TV. First, check all the connections. Make sure the power cord is plugged in and that the TV is set to the correct input. If everything looks good there, try pressing the power button again.
If your TV still won’t turn on, there could be a problem with the power supply. Try unplugging the TV for a few minutes and then plugging it back in. If that doesn’t work, you may need to replace the power supply.
If your TV turns on but there is no picture, the first thing to check is the input. Make sure you have selected the correct input. If that doesn’t work, try adjusting the antenna or cable connection.
If you’re still having problems, it’s time to call a TV repairman. But don’t give up hope! With a little troubleshooting, you may be able to fix your TV yourself.]]></summary>

Cerberus, also known as the “hellhound”, is a fearsome creature from Greek mythology. He is said to have three heads, each of which can breathe fire, and he guards the entrance to the Underworld.
So it’s no wonder that one father was surprised to see his three young children pictured with the dog-like creature in a photo his wife had taken. The children are pictured looking up at the camera with Cerberus in the background, and the father is clearly amazed by the resemblance.
While it is certainly an unusual picture, it is also a very cute one. It’s clear that the children are not afraid of the so-called “hellhound” and, in fact, seem to be quite fond of him.
This is just one example of the power of imagination and the ability of children to see the world in a different way to adults. It’s a reminder that, sometimes, the seemingly impossible can be completely believable to those with less experience of the world.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an effort to protect our pets and prevent the spread of rabies, Oyster Bay Town Councilman Lou Imbroto announced that the Town, in partnership with the Nassau County Department of Health, will offer free rabies vaccinations for dogs, cats and ferrets. Open to all residents, the vaccination clinic will be held on Saturday, September 17th, from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. at the Town Animal Shelter located at 150 Miller Place in Syosset. No reservations are necessary. “We consider our pets to be members of our family and want to do everything possible to protect them from harm and poor health,” said Councilman Imbroto. “Pet owners can take advantage of this free vaccination clinic, which protects our pets and our families.” New York State law requires that all dogs, cats and domesticated ferrets be vaccinated against rabies.  If an unvaccinated pet or one that’s overdue for its vaccination comes into contact with a rabid or suspected rabid animal, the pet must either be euthanized or strictly quarantined for six months.  However, if a vaccinated animal comes into contact with a wild animal, it needs only a booster vaccination which must be administered within five days of exposure. To protect your family and your pet, it is essential that your animals have up-to-date rabies inoculations. It is recommended for dogs, cats and ferrets older than four months to receive their first two shots one year apart and additional booster shots every three years thereafter.  Dogs must be on leash at all times and cats and ferrets must be in enclosed carriers. The clinic also offers to microchip pets for $25. Microchips carry a unique identification number for a pet so if they ever get lost they can be taken to a vet clinic or animal shelter where they will be scanned for the unique microchip ID number.  No reservations are necessary for the clinic. For more information, contact the Town of Oyster Bay Animal Shelter at (516) 677-5784 or visit www.oysterbaytown.com.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big news everyone! I adopted a new ferret! He is two years old and his name will be revealed when I post my upcoming YouTube video that talks all about him!
How he landed in my lap is a funny story too, which I’ll talk all about soon! 
Stuff I love about this little dude: he naps with me in my hammock, he follows me everywhere, and he war dances like crazy!
Also, my dream was always to have a ferret that would happily CHOOSE to sleep on the bed with me. Well, one day recently my little dude figured out how to climb up my bed. And what did he do once he got there? Promptly curled up and fell asleep.
He has been such a blessing during this time in my life. He does remind me a lot of Moose. More info to come!
Love you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PHOENIX — The Phoenix Zoo gave names to four of its new 21 endangered black-footed ferret kits through voting from Valley residents online.
With over 2,100 votes, the names selected in a landslide were Maple, Acacia, Cedar and Willow, according to a press release.
The Phoenix Zoo is one of six zoos worldwide that breeds black-footed ferrets, one of the most endangered North American species, that ultimately get released back into the wild. “We are thrilled to have another successful black-footed ferret breeding season and excited for these little kits to grow up and contribute to the recovery of their species,” Director of Conservation and Science at the Phoenix Zoo. Dr. Tara Harris said.
The zoo has produced over 500 black-footed ferrets in the 30 years that it has been breeding the animals. In 2021, 13 ferrets were released back into the wild in Colorado.
The kits live in specially designed den boxes with their mothers, according to the release,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AUSTINTOWN, Ohio (WKBN) – A neglected dog and five ferrets are safe after being rescued by an Animal Charity humane agent Thursday. “Someone left them there intentionally. Tyson is extremely underweight. He is starved, almost to death,” said Jane MacMurchy, operations director at Animal Charity. Tyson weighed only 46 pounds. He was found in an abandoned Austintown apartment, collapsed in a bathroom, unable to stand, according to an Animal Charity Facebook post.  “This wasn’t just a situation where maybe somebody left their animal with somebody else to take care of, you know it was very clear that they were intentionally abandoned and left to starve,” MacMurchy said. MacMurchy says Tyson was cached with urine and feces, because he couldn’t stand up to use the bathroom. She said the ferrets were dehydrated and lethargic. “It took a village to save Tyson and five ferrets seemingly left to die in an apartment yesterday,” the post stated. Animal Charity did not have a vet on staff yesterday so they called Friends Of Fido MCDP and Tyson was rushed to a local vet clinic for emergency care. Tyson was given lifesaving fluids and started on small meals to slowly reintroduce his body to food. He was also given a bath to remove the caked-on feces and urine.  The ferrets were given lifesaving fluids and a slow introduction to food as well. MacMurchy says they will be pressing criminal charges against the owner, which may include animal cruelty and prohibitions concerning animals. “The first step is the probable cause hearing, then the next step is to pursue criminal charges,” she said. Both Tyson and the ferrets are doing well and in the care of Animal Charity. Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AUSTINTOWN, Ohio (WKBN) – A neglected dog and five ferrets are safe after being rescued by an Animal Charity humane agent Thursday. “Someone left them there intentionally. Tyson is extremely underweight. He is starved, almost to death,” said Jane MacMurchy, operations director at Animal Charity. Tyson weighed only 46 pounds. He was found in an abandoned Austintown apartment, collapsed in a bathroom, unable to stand, according to an Animal Charity Facebook post.  “This wasn’t just a situation where maybe somebody left their animal with somebody else to take care of, you know it was very clear that they were intentionally abandoned and left to starve,” MacMurchy said. MacMurchy says Tyson was cached with urine and feces, because he couldn’t stand up to use the bathroom. She said the ferrets were dehydrated and lethargic. “It took a village to save Tyson and five ferrets seemingly left to die in an apartment yesterday,” the post stated. Animal Charity did not have a vet on staff yesterday so they called Friends Of Fido MCDP and Tyson was rushed to a local vet clinic for emergency care. Tyson was given lifesaving fluids and started on small meals to slowly reintroduce his body to food. He was also given a bath to remove the caked-on feces and urine.  The ferrets were given lifesaving fluids and a slow introduction to food as well. MacMurchy says they will be pressing criminal charges against the owner, which may include animal cruelty and prohibitions concerning animals. “The first step is the probable cause hearing, then the next step is to pursue criminal charges,” she said. Both Tyson and the ferrets are doing well and in the care of Animal Charity. Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
