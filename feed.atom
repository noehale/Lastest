        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What Do Ferrets Eat?
The short answer: meat, bones, and organs.
The easiest way to venture a guess as to what a ferret should eat is to look at their teeth. Does this ferret’s mouth (above) remind you of any other animals’ mouths you may know?
To me it looks an awful lot like a small dog or cat, NOT a rat or a mouse.
These ferret's teeth are sharp in order to tear through the meat and bone of their prey! How cool!

This program has absolutely changed my life and touched my heart in ways I never would’ve expected.

“I walked out of Time Warner after shopping at Whole Foods and almost collided with it. Then about 30 people including me were taking pics and following it. It walked alongside the entire front of the mall, then darted under a cop car. Some animal-loving woman tried to lure it back but it crossed the road and ended up in Columbus Circle. The woman and a guard from Time Warner (on his phone alerting security) threw a coat over it but it ran out from under. By this point, the crowd grew and I left!  No owner showed up.
