        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FORT BELKNAP AGENCY, Mont. —  Native species such as swift foxes and black-footed ferrets disappeared from the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation generations ago, wiped out by poisoning campaigns, disease and farm plows that turned open prairie where nomadic tribes once roamed into cropland and cattle pastures. Now with guidance from elders and outside wildlife groups, students and interns from the tribal college are helping reintroduce the small predators to the northern Montana reservation sprawling across more than 1,000 square milesnear the U.S.-Canada border.Sakura Main, a 24-year-old Aaniiih woman who is entering Fort Belknap’s Aaniiih Nakoda College in January, is helping to locate, trap and vaccinate the severely endangered ferrets against deadly plague in a program overseen by the tr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been a huge animal person since I was a toddler. My parents said I always gravitated towards animals and books about nature even before I could talk. I’ve had hamsters, rats, chinchillas, hedgehogs, dogs, cats, snakes, and lizards. Now I joke that I was searching for ferrets all that time -I just didn’t know it yet!
When I got Moose (my first ferret), I wasn’t actually planning on getting a ferret at all. I went to a pet store to purchase a hedgehog with my boyfriend at the time. I had already owned one so I knew what the care would entail. However, when we arrived at the pet store where we meant to go check out the hedgehogs, we were instead struck by how playful and adorable the ferrets were. Many people describe ferrets as a combination of the best qualities of a puppy and a kitten rolled into one. I can attest to that!
There was one particular little ball of fluff that caught my eye. He was very dark brown and sat all alone in the corner. I reached my hands into the tank and plucked him out. I set this little kit in the crook of my forearm, belly up, and he gazed right into my eyes. What really struck me is how calmly he sat there staring at me and taking this world in. That baby was Moose, of course, and it was absolutely love at first sight. I have been head-over-heels for ferrets ever since that day.

But I didn’t go to Google. I asked my sister, Dianne Hollis Lundy. I mean, that’s one thing big sisters are good for, right? Helping you figure out this enigmatic world? Without batting an eye, as if she’d rehearsed the answer her entire life, she said, “It’s talking about the cardinal.” Bingo. I suddenly remembered all the Christmas cards with redbirds gracing their covers. Sister’s answer made total sense (even though if you actually do a web search regarding the question, several other hardto- believe explanations surface). Anot…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's talk ferret UTI's!
They are caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the urinary systems -usually E. Coli or Staphylococcus. If left untreated, UTI’s can lead to kidney infections in ferrets.
Here are some symptoms to look out for:
Straining to pee, only peeing small amounts at a time, trying to pee but can’t, overly smelly pee. 
Have you had any experience with this one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are a new ferret owner, it is vital that you provide them with all the best ferret supplies they need to stay happy and healthy. I have a Youtube video called "Top Recommended Ferret Products" that you can check out on Youtube through my link in bio.
In the meantime, here are some thoughts on food/water dishes: 
Ferrets are notorious for knocking things over. This includes a lightweight food or water bowl. I recommend finding a set of heavy ceramic bowls that they are unable to move on their own. Make sure to place them on the bottom of the cage so they cannot fall and injure your ferret.
You can also opt to buy food and water bowls that attach to the cage. Many ferret owners have had great success with these as well.
Hope this helps someone today. Do you guys have any other suggestions for food and water bowls?

Chumming is defined in California Code of Regulations as follows: “Placing any material in the water, other than on a hook while angling, for the purpose of attracting fish to a particular area in order that they may be taken.”There are a few waterways in California where chumming is legal: The Colorado River District, but only approved bait fishes may be used as chum except in the Salton Sea where corn may also be used.Carquinez Strait …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image source, GoogleImage caption, The venue originally opened as The Mad Ferret in 2006A city centre music venue could close unless campaigners raise the remaining £150,000 needed to buy the building it is housed in. The Ferret in Preston, which has hosted Ed Sheeran, Buzzcocks and Idles, is set to go on the market in three weeks. In May, the council temporarily blocked a commercial sale for six months to give locals time to prepare a bid. A buyer is yet to be found but the Music Venue Trust is stepping in to try raise the funds. The charity, which tries to save grassroots gig spaces, said it was seeking donations both locally and nationally. Chief Executive Mark Davyd said he was "pretty confident" that "unless it's sold to us, we don't think it will be sold to be a music venue". "What we need to be able to do is go to the landlord and say we want to put a bid in - and do that before they go back to market."That building has to be a music venue - it's in the ideal place to be one. And it's so important to Preston, we know that," he added. The site, which employs about 10 staff, originally opened as The Mad Ferret in 2006 and became a cornerstone of the University of Central Lancashire's student quarter, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.The property, which is not wholly occupied by The Ferret, went on the market with a price tag of £795,000 back in March.It was described in the listing as having potential for a "residential conversion". A fundraising page set up last week has so far seen over £6,800 pledged.The venue's managing director Sue Culshaw said: "Anybody can donate and it will give people a chance to show that they care about The Ferret. "The building is back on the open market and anybody can step in and buy it - and either turf us out or raise the rent through the roof, whatever they choose."Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?
