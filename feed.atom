Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … The ferret and the owner who did not know what had happenedWhen feline owners go on vacation, they typically ask a friend or neighbor to check in on their pet. Water the plants, bring in the mail, and, oh, make sure the cat has food and water. What they may not think to do is ferret-proof their home before they leave.Ferrets are playful and curious by nature, and will often explore every nook and cranny of their home. This can often lead to trouble, as they may find themselves in places they’re not supposed to be. Case in point: one ferret owner came home to find her pet had gotten into the dryer and couldn’t get out.Luckily, the ferret was unharmed and the owner was able to laugh about the situation. However, it’s important to take measures to prevent this from happening to your own pet. Before you go on vacation, be sure to ferret-proof your home to keep your furry friend safe and sound.]]></summary>

They are really large and they work great in the Mid West Ferret Cage as well as in corners around the house. The size I have is also big enough to cut in half to get more use out of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[photo bomb!
A photo bomb is when someone intentionally or unintentionally photo bombs your picture. It can ruin a perfectly good selfie or group photo, and it’s often done for the sake of a laugh. But, if you’re not careful, a photo bomb can also be a security risk.
So, how do you avoid getting photo bombed? First, be aware of your surroundings. If you’re in a public place, there’s a greater chance that someone will try to photo bomb your picture. Second, keep your camera out of reach. If you’re holding your camera in your hand, it’s easy for someone to lean in and photo bomb you. Third, watch for people who seem like they might be trying to photo bomb you. If someone is standing behind you and creeping into your frame, they’re probably trying to photo bomb you. Finally, if you see someone photo bombing someone else’s picture, be prepared to intervene. It’s not always easy to stop a photo bomb, but if you’re quick, you might be able to save the day.
If you’re the victim of a photo bomb, don’t despair. There are a few things you can do to fix the situation. First, try cropping the photo. This will get rid of the person who photo bombed you, and it might even make the photo look better. Second, try edit the photo. There are a number of apps that let you remove unwanted people from photos. Third, if all else fails, you can always take another photo.
So, there you have it. A few tips to help you avoid getting photo bombed, and a few tips to help you fix a photo that’s been photo bombed. Just remember, if you’re ever in doubt, it’s always better to err on the side of caution.]]></summary>

I can't help but sit here and reflect on the last 30 years (and the last 2 years in particular when a lot in my life changed). 
My biggest prayer for my 29th birthday was that my life not necessarily get any easier but that it be filled with beauty and meaning. I have to say God answered that prayer and has enriched my life in ways that fill me with joy and hope every day!
One thing I feel like I'm being called to do is create more positive content for you all to enjoy again. I am very excited to get back to creating for you guys -it'll be a bit slower though as I'm now running this channel by myself.
Any kind words of encouragement are much appreciated as I read these comments when I want a reminder of why I'm doing it.
Love you all and I hope you know that I count all of YOU as a blessing on my birthday!(Feed generated with FetchRSS)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[she didn’t appreciate me taking her to the vet
When you love someone, you want to take care of them – even when they don’t want you to. Such was the case for one woman whose cat didn’t appreciate her taking it to the vet.
The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, told the story of how she took her cat to the vet for a routine check-up. Everything seemed to be going fine until the cat started hissing and clawing at her.
“I was really shaken up by the experience,” the woman said. “I’ve never seen my cat act like that before.”
It’s natural to want to take care of our loved ones, but sometimes they don’t appreciate our efforts. In this case, the cat’s owner did the right thing by taking it to the vet – even if it didn’t show its appreciation.]]></summary>

Brushing removes plaque and bacteria from the teeth and gums, and flossing removes plaque and bacteria from between the teeth. Good hygiene also includes rinsing with mouthwash, which helps to remove plaque and bacteria from the teeth and gums.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[when your tiny ferret just fits perfectly in your hand
Ferrets are adorable and loving animals that make great pets. They are also very active and playful, which can make them a handful at times. But their small size also means they can be easily carried around, and this is especially evident when they just fit perfectly in the palm of your hand.
There is something special about being able to hold your ferret in your hand. They are so small and delicate, and yet they are also full of life and energy. When they are contentedly snuggled in your hand, it is a moment of calm in the midst of their playful chaos.
Of course, this is not to say that you can or should carry your ferret around all the time. They still need plenty of space to run and play. But it is nice to know that when you need a break, or when your ferret needs a break from all the action, you can simply scoop them up and hold them close. And in those moments, everything feels right in the world.]]></summary>

Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … A lot of people think that keeping a ferret as a pet is a lot of work. They are correct in some ways as these small, lively mammals require a bit more care than your average pet. But what they lack in size, they make up for in personality. Ferrets are very sociable animals that enjoy human interaction and make great additions to any family.For starters, ferrets are highly active. They need at least four hours of playtime every day, so if you’re gone all day or tend to be lazy, a ferret is probably not the right pet for you. They also need a lot of exercise, so a large home with plenty of space to run around is a must.However, if you’re up for the challenge, a ferret can be a great pet. They are very affectionate animals and love to cuddle. They are also very inquisitive and love to explore, so you’ll never be bored when you have a ferret around.Ferrets are also very social animals and do best when they have another ferret friend to play with. If you’re considering adopting a ferret, be sure to get two so they can keep each other company.So, if you’re looking for a small, lively, and affectionate pet, a ferret may be the perfect choice for you. Just be sure you’re prepared to give them the time and attention they need.]]></summary>

We can all relate to feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope at times. It’s a shared human experience. We can all relate to feeling anxious and stressed, wanting to escape and hide away from the world. These are just some of the many emotions and experiences we share as human beings.
When we feel these things, it can be helpful to remember that we’re not alone. We can all relate to each other in these ways. We can find comfort in knowing that we’re all going through similar things. We can give and receive support from each other.
If you’re feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or any other negative emotion, reach out to someone you trust. Talk to them about how you’re feeling. They may be feeling the same way and can offer you support. We all need help sometimes. Don’t be afraid to ask for it.]]></summary>

I wasn’t expecting it at all and, to be honest, I don’t think I had even entered one. But there it was in my inbox, congratulations on being a winner!It took me a few minutes to figure out what I had won, and then a few more to track down the contest entry form. As it turns out, I had entered a contest several months ago and forgotten all about it. The prize was a $100 gift card to a store I love.While it was exciting to receive the notification and prize, it did leave me feeling a little lost. I realized that I had let myself forget about an ongoing contest and, as a result, had missed out on the opportunity to maybe win something bigger.It’s a good reminder to stay aware of the contests you’ve entered and to keep track of them, even if you don’t think you’ll win.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[he went full cuteness mode
When it comes to getting attention, few things are as effective as cuteness. And when someone really wants to lay it on thick, they’ll go full cuteness mode.
Whether it’s a baby making faces, a puppy wagging its tail, or a kitten playing with a ball of string, the power of cuteness is undeniable. And when someone really wants to ramp up the cute factor, they’ll go all out.
They might make faces, use a high-pitched voice, or dress up in a cutesy outfit. Whatever the method, the goal is always the same: to look as adorable as possible.
While it might seem like a desperate move, there’s actually a lot of strategy involved in going full cuteness mode. After all, it’s not easy to pull off. But when it’s done well, it can be extremely effective.
So next time you see someone going full cuteness mode, don’t be too quick to judge. They might just be trying to get your attention. And who knows? They might just succeed.]]></summary>

Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … If you’re thinking about moving the toilet in your home, think again. It may seem like a good idea to change the location of the toilet, but there are a few things you need to consider before you make the change.For starters, the location of the toilet is determined by the home’s sewer line. The sewer line is the pipe that carries waste water from the home to the municipal sewer system. The location of the sewer line is typically governed by building codes, which means that if you move the toilet, you may also need to move the sewer line. This can be a costly and time-consuming project.Additionally, the toilet is connected to the home’s water supply. This means that if you move the toilet, you’ll also need to reroute the water supply lines. This can be a tricky process, and if it’s not done correctly, it could result in a leak.Finally, you need to take into account the fact that the toilet is one of the most-used fixtures in the home. This means that relocating it could be a major inconvenience for you and your family.Therefore, before you make the decision to move the toilet, weigh the pros and cons carefully. It may be best to leave the toilet where it is.]]></summary>

After a long day at work, there is nothing better than coming home and plopping down in front of the TV to relax. But what if your TV is broken? You may be in for a long, frustrating night.
But don’t despair! There are a few things you can do to try to fix your TV. First, check all the connections. Make sure the power cord is plugged in and that the TV is set to the correct input. If everything looks good there, try pressing the power button again.
If your TV still won’t turn on, there could be a problem with the power supply. Try unplugging the TV for a few minutes and then plugging it back in. If that doesn’t work, you may need to replace the power supply.
If your TV turns on but there is no picture, the first thing to check is the input. Make sure you have selected the correct input. If that doesn’t work, try adjusting the antenna or cable connection.
If you’re still having problems, it’s time to call a TV repairman. But don’t give up hope! With a little troubleshooting, you may be able to fix your TV yourself.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife got this picture and it made my three look like Cerberus
Cerberus, also known as the “hellhound”, is a fearsome creature from Greek mythology. He is said to have three heads, each of which can breathe fire, and he guards the entrance to the Underworld.
So it’s no wonder that one father was surprised to see his three young children pictured with the dog-like creature in a photo his wife had taken. The children are pictured looking up at the camera with Cerberus in the background, and the father is clearly amazed by the resemblance.
While it is certainly an unusual picture, it is also a very cute one. It’s clear that the children are not afraid of the so-called “hellhound” and, in fact, seem to be quite fond of him.
This is just one example of the power of imagination and the ability of children to see the world in a different way to adults. It’s a reminder that, sometimes, the seemingly impossible can be completely believable to those with less experience of the world.]]></summary>

Ferrets are wonderful, playful pets that will bring you endless hours of joy – but before you rushes out to buy one, there are a few things you should know. Here are 5 more things you need to know before owning a ferret:1. They’re high energyFerrets are high energy creatures that need to be constantly active – if they’re not, they can become depressed or even ill. A good way to keep your ferret healthy and happy is to provide them with plenty of toys and playtime.2. They have a strong sense of smellFerrets have a very strong sense of smell, which can be both a good and a bad thing. On the plus side, this means they’re great at finding things – but it also means they can be quite smelly creatures! Be sure to clean their cage regularly and provide them with fresh bedding to help control the odor.3. They’re escape artistsFerrets are known for their escape artist tendencies, so it’s important to make sure their cage is well-secured. If your ferret does manage to escape, don’t be surprised if they end up in some unlikely places – they’re very good at finding their way around!4. They’re social creaturesFerrets are very social creatures and love to interact with their human companions. They can be quite playful, and many enjoy being held and cuddled. If you’re considering getting a ferret, be prepared to spend plenty of time playing with and caring for them.5. They have a relatively short lifespanFerrets have a relatively short lifespan compared to other pets, typically living for 6 to 8 years. This is something to keep in mind when deciding whether or not a ferret is the right pet for you.If you’re considering adding a ferret to your family, be sure to do your research and consider all of the pros and cons before making your decision. With a little preparation, you’ll be well on your way to enjoying many years of ferret ownership!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an effort to protect our pets and prevent the spread of rabies, Oyster Bay Town Councilman Lou Imbroto announced that the Town, in partnership with the Nassau County Department of Health, will offer free rabies vaccinations for dogs, cats and ferrets. Open to all residents, the vaccination clinic will be held on Saturday, September 17th, from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. at the Town Animal Shelter located at 150 Miller Place in Syosset. No reservations are necessary. “We consider our pets to be members of our family and want to do everything possible to protect them from harm and poor health,” said Councilman Imbroto. “Pet owners can take advantage of this free vaccination clinic, which protects our pets and our families.” New York State law requires that all dogs, cats and domesticated ferrets be vaccinated against rabies.  If an unvaccinated pet or one that’s overdue for its vaccination comes into contact with a rabid or suspected rabid animal, the pet must either be euthanized or strictly quarantined for six months.  However, if a vaccinated animal comes into contact with a wild animal, it needs only a booster vaccination which must be administered within five days of exposure. To protect your family and your pet, it is essential that your animals have up-to-date rabies inoculations. It is recommended for dogs, cats and ferrets older than four months to receive their first two shots one year apart and additional booster shots every three years thereafter.  Dogs must be on leash at all times and cats and ferrets must be in enclosed carriers. The clinic also offers to microchip pets for $25. Microchips carry a unique identification number for a pet so if they ever get lost they can be taken to a vet clinic or animal shelter where they will be scanned for the unique microchip ID number.  No reservations are necessary for the clinic. For more information, contact the Town of Oyster Bay Animal Shelter at (516) 677-5784 or visit www.oysterbaytown.com.]]></summary>

How he landed in my lap is a funny story too, which I’ll talk all about soon! 
Stuff I love about this little dude: he naps with me in my hammock, he follows me everywhere, and he war dances like crazy!
Also, my dream was always to have a ferret that would happily CHOOSE to sleep on the bed with me. Well, one day recently my little dude figured out how to climb up my bed. And what did he do once he got there? Promptly curled up and fell asleep.
He has been such a blessing during this time in my life. He does remind me a lot of Moose. More info to come!
Love you all!
