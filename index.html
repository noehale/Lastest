          <p>Hello lovely people. I just want to say thank you for following my journey with ferrets these last 8 years. It is such a blessing to be able to geek out about ferrets with you all. 
I have always loved animals but like I&#x27;ve said before, I think all along I was just looking for a ferret! They are the perfect pet in so many ways. Don&#x27;t you agree? 
Was anyone else just looking for ferrets all along too? Why do they fit us so perfectly?
Love you all!
P.S. the sweatshirt in this picture is from my Etsy shop (link in bio)! It says &#x27;Ferrets&#x27; in the style of the Friends TV show logo.

          <p>Watch Where You Step: Ferrets love to sleep in clothes that smell like you. Dirty clothes smell the strongest so don‚Äôt be surprised if you find your ferret curled up in the pajama pants you threw on the floor. This can become dangerous when you keep clothes scattered all over your floor. Think of it like a ‚Äòferret mine field‚Äô. Any piece of clothing could contain a ferret and if you step on them, you can cause serious injury. You have two options for this. You can either change your habits and keep all clothing off the floor, or you can shuffle your feet when you walk instead of stepping.

ECE (Epizootic catarrhal enteritis) is an inflammation of the intestinal lining that if left untreated can cause liver damage and death; it is a common and life-threatening illness in ferrets that is extremely contagious! It&#x27;s nickname in the ferret community is &#x27;green-slime&#x27;.
Has anybody here had experience with this one? What was it like? Thank you for sharing!

I think it&#x27;s crucial to get something that zips (vs. velcro or doesn&#x27;t have a bottom). What do you guys think?
This particular one is available in The Modern Ferret Amazon shop if you are looking for a pretty solid one.
