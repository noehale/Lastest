Take some time to read. It&#x27;s a fun one!

          <p>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) - This week, 30 federally threatened black-footed ferrets were released on Colorado‚Äôs eastern plains.The ferrets, one of the rarest mammals in North America, were raised at a U.S. Fish and Wildlife breeding facility. According to CPW‚Äôs website, black-footed ferrets were thought to be extinct twice, and were absent from Colorado since the early 1940s. A small population was found in Wyoming in 1981, which was used to help boost populations in the region. Officials say that there are currently about 600 black-footed ferrets both in captivity and the wild, and that all black-footed ferrets are now descendants of that population found in Wyoming.The ferrets were first reintroduced to Colorado back in 2001. This week‚Äôs release marks the eighth release site in eastern Colorado. The ferrets were released land owned by the Southern Plains Land Trust.See video of the release from Colorado Parks &amp; Wildlife here:Copyright 2022 KKTV. All rights reserved.</p>

          <p>Ferrets are pretty cool pets. They‚Äôre friendly, smart, super curious and fun to hang out with!But when it comes to taking care of your new friend, you might be wondering ‚Äî what do ferrets eat?To find out what the best foods are to feed your ferret (and those to avoid), we reached out to Samantha Henson, a certified clinical pet nutritionist with Next Generation Pet Wellness, and Dr. Robert Fillman, a veterinarian at GeoZoo (and ferret parent!).What do ferrets eat?Well, for starters, ferrets are carnivores ‚Äî or more specifically, obligate carnivores. This means that their diet should consist of at least 70 percent meat.‚ÄúMuch like tigers, alligators and snakes, ferrets need meat to survive and cannot turn plant proteins into what their bodies need,‚Äù Henson told The Dodo. ‚ÄúThey thrive on a di‚Ä¶</p>

          <p>The Watcher. (L to R) Luke David Blumm as Carter Brannock, Bobby Cannavale as Dean Brannock in episode 102 of The Watcher. Cr. Eric Liebowitz/Netflix ¬© 2022A new mystery-thriller series titled¬†The Watcher is now streaming on Netflix. It follows a family who after moving into their dream home, begins receiving threatening letters from a mysterious stalker called ‚ÄúThe Watcher.‚Äù While watching the series, you might start to have questions. Actually, a question we‚Äôre seeing being asked a lot revolves around a ferret.Spoilers from The Watcher ahead!We‚Äôre introduced to the ferret in episode 1. As the Brannock family moves into the 657 Boulevard house, Carter comes down the stairs carrying his pet ferret named Sprinkles. He asks Dean where the ferret‚Äôs leash is, and Dean replies that he doesn‚Äôt know. Then, Dean tells Carter not to let Sprinkles run all over the house because he doesn‚Äôt want them peeing everywhere.¬†Later in the episode, we find out that Dean and Nora bought Carter the ferret to make him feel comfortable about moving into the new house.Flash forward further into the episode, Sprinkles escapes from their cage and ventures around the house as the Brannocks are asleep. But then the ferret is snatched up by a person with black gloves. So, what happens to Sprinkles? Do they die?Sadly, Sprinkles does die. The next morning, Carter gets up and walks out of his room to find Sprinkles bleeding profusely from their head. Then, the Brannocks call the police to find out who broke into their home and killed Sprinkles. The detective tells them there‚Äôs nothing he can do because there‚Äôs no proof that someone broke in. He continues and says that all the doors were locked, and there were no signs of forced entry. By the end of the season, we never find out who killed Sprinkles.The Watcher is now available to stream on Netflix.Here‚Äôs more content on¬†The Watcher¬†to check out!

          <p>The internet was in hysterics after a cat brought a ferret friend home to play.Cats are sometimes known to protect their personal space and are wary of anything that interferes with that, but in one instance, a cat appeared to have made friends with a neighborhood ferret and even brought him home for a snack.While ferrets are considered to be social animals - recommended to be kept in pairs - there are several considerations that should be factored in when introducing them to other species.File photo of cat and ferret.

          <p>BILLINGS¬†‚Äî¬†Life in the animal kingdom is tough, and bouncing back from the edge of extinction is even tougher. But that‚Äôs exactly what the black-footed ferret is trying to do with a little help from animal biologists.&quot;These animals genetically were down to seven animals. Only seven animals left that were breeding and so to know that their numbers are bouncing back, there‚Äôs about 300-400 out in the wild right now. It‚Äôs a true success story. We released 18 of these incredibly endangered, one of the most endangered animals in North America, back to their natural habitat and it was an amazing experience,&quot; said Jeff Ewelt, executive director at ZooMontana.Prior to 1981, most biologists believed the black-footed ferret was extinct, but that all changed one day on the Hog family ranch near Meetee‚Ä¶</p>

          <p>BRYAN, Texas (KBTX) - It‚Äôs not every day that veterinarians at the Texas A&amp;M Small Animal Teaching Hospital (SATH) get to sew a pacemaker onto a beating heart roughly the size of a grape!But when Hypnos, a 5-year-old ferret, arrived at the SATH with a very slow heart rate, his veterinary team took on the challenge of helping the beloved pet return home healthy to his owner and ferret friends. This was the first ferret pacemaker procedure at the SATH in almost 10 years.Copyright 2022 KBTX. All rights reserved.</p>

          <p>I‚Äôm Bikke from Marshall Ferret and Butterscotch born on January 19, 2019. Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 ‚Ä¶ by I don‚Äôt know about you, but there have been times in my life when I‚Äôve been so tired that I thought I would just wake up and go back to bed. It‚Äôs not uncommon to feel this way after a long day at work or a night out with friends. However, there are times when this feeling can be more intense and last for several days. If you find yourself in this situation, it‚Äôs important to listen to your body and get the rest you need.It can be hard to let go of the things you need to do in order to get some rest, but it‚Äôs important to remember that your health comes first. If you‚Äôre feeling exhausted, try to take a nap or go to bed early. And if you find yourself struggling to stay awake, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help. There‚Äôs no shame in admitting that you need some assistance.In short, don‚Äôt push yourself too hard if you‚Äôre feeling tired. Get the rest you need and take care of yourself. Your body will thank you for it.</p>
