          <p>PHOENIX ‚Äî The Phoenix Zoo gave names to four of its new 21 endangered black-footed ferret kits through voting from Valley residents online.
With over 2,100 votes, the names selected in a landslide were Maple, Acacia, Cedar and Willow, according to a press release.
The Phoenix Zoo is one of six zoos worldwide that breeds black-footed ferrets, one of the most endangered North American species, that ultimately get released back into the wild. ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to have another successful black-footed ferret breeding season and excited for these little kits to grow up and contribute to the recovery of their species,‚Äù Director of Conservation and Science at the Phoenix Zoo. Dr. Tara Harris said.
The zoo has produced over 500 black-footed ferrets in the 30 years that it has been breeding the animals. In 2021, 13 ferrets were released back into the wild in Colorado.
The kits live in specially designed den boxes with their mothers, according to the release,

          <p>AUSTINTOWN, Ohio (WKBN) ‚Äì A neglected dog and five ferrets are safe after being rescued by an Animal Charity humane agent Thursday. ‚ÄúSomeone left them there intentionally. Tyson is extremely underweight. He is starved, almost to death,‚Äù said Jane MacMurchy, operations director at Animal Charity. Tyson weighed only 46 pounds. He was found in an abandoned Austintown apartment, collapsed in a bathroom, unable to stand, according to an Animal Charity Facebook post.  ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt just a situation where maybe somebody left their animal with somebody else to take care of, you know it was very clear that they were intentionally abandoned and left to starve,‚Äù MacMurchy said. MacMurchy says Tyson was cached with urine and feces, because he couldn‚Äôt stand up to use the bathroom. She said the ferrets were dehydrated and lethargic. ‚ÄúIt took a village to save Tyson and five ferrets seemingly left to die in an apartment yesterday,‚Äù the post stated. Animal Charity did not have a vet on staff yesterday so they called Friends Of Fido MCDP and Tyson was rushed to a local vet clinic for emergency care. Tyson was given lifesaving fluids and started on small meals to slowly reintroduce his body to food. He was also given a bath to remove the caked-on feces and urine.  The ferrets were given lifesaving fluids and a slow introduction to food as well. MacMurchy says they will be pressing criminal charges against the owner, which may include animal cruelty and prohibitions concerning animals. ‚ÄúThe first step is the probable cause hearing, then the next step is to pursue criminal charges,‚Äù she said. Both Tyson and the ferrets are doing well and in the care of Animal Charity. Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

          <p>The Arizona Center for Nature Conservation/Phoenix Zoo welcomed five more litters of the highly-endangered black-footed ferrets this May and June at its Elaine V. Johnson Conservation Center.¬†There are 21 baby ferrets, or kits, in all born to mothers Akoya, Roseanne, Vermillion, Lady Mary and Canneles, and some will be identified as candidates to be released into the wild.¬†According to Tara Harris, the director of conservation and science for the Phoenix Zoo who oversees its breeding and recovery programs, there are only a few hundred of the animals living in the wild today.¬†Black-footed ferrets are one of the most endangered animals in North America and were actually thought to be extinct, though they were rediscovered in 1981 in Wyoming, according to the Black-footed Ferret Connection.

Owners praise the animals as &quot;clean as cats and friendly as dogs.&quot; With training, ferrets can even learn to do a few tricks.&quot;I have raised both cats and dogs, and yes, my lovely Kai Kai is as cute as expected,&quot; the marketing specialist said of her new pet.The angora is a relatively new breed of ferret, in existence for about three decades.Deng bought her ferret from a shop at the Lanling Flower &amp; Bird Market ‚Äì the largest venue selling pets and ornamental plants in Shanghai.The shop, operated by Ding Ning, is‚Ä¶</p>
