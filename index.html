          <p>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) - This week, 30 federally threatened black-footed ferrets were released on Colorado’s eastern plains.The ferrets, one of the rarest mammals in North America, were raised at a U.S. Fish and Wildlife breeding facility. According to CPW’s website, black-footed ferrets were thought to be extinct twice, and were absent from Colorado since the early 1940s. A small population was found in Wyoming in 1981, which was used to help boost populations in the region. Officials say that there are currently about 600 black-footed ferrets both in captivity and the wild, and that all black-footed ferrets are now descendants of that population found in Wyoming.The ferrets were first reintroduced to Colorado back in 2001. This week’s release marks the eighth release site in eastern Colorado. The ferrets were released land owned by the Southern Plains Land Trust.See video of the release from Colorado Parks &amp; Wildlife here:Copyright 2022 KKTV. All rights reserved.</p>

          <p>Ferrets are pretty cool pets. They’re friendly, smart, super curious and fun to hang out with!But when it comes to taking care of your new friend, you might be wondering — what do ferrets eat?To find out what the best foods are to feed your ferret (and those to avoid), we reached out to Samantha Henson, a certified clinical pet nutritionist with Next Generation Pet Wellness, and Dr. Robert Fillman, a veterinarian at GeoZoo (and ferret parent!).What do ferrets eat?Well, for starters, ferrets are carnivores — or more specifically, obligate carnivores. This means that their diet should consist of at least 70 percent meat.“Much like tigers, alligators and snakes, ferrets need meat to survive and cannot turn plant proteins into what their bodies need,” Henson told The Dodo. “They thrive on a di…</p>

          <p>The Watcher. (L to R) Luke David Blumm as Carter Brannock, Bobby Cannavale as Dean Brannock in episode 102 of The Watcher. Cr. Eric Liebowitz/Netflix © 2022A new mystery-thriller series titled The Watcher is now streaming on Netflix. It follows a family who after moving into their dream home, begins receiving threatening letters from a mysterious stalker called “The Watcher.” While watching the series, you might start to have questions. Actually, a question we’re seeing being asked a lot revolves around a ferret.Spoilers from The Watcher ahead!We’re introduced to the ferret in episode 1. As the Brannock family moves into the 657 Boulevard house, Carter comes down the stairs carrying his pet ferret named Sprinkles. He asks Dean where the ferret’s leash is, and Dean replies that he doesn’t know. Then, Dean tells Carter not to let Sprinkles run all over the house because he doesn’t want them peeing everywhere. Later in the episode, we find out that Dean and Nora bought Carter the ferret to make him feel comfortable about moving into the new house.Flash forward further into the episode, Sprinkles escapes from their cage and ventures around the house as the Brannocks are asleep. But then the ferret is snatched up by a person with black gloves. So, what happens to Sprinkles? Do they die?Sadly, Sprinkles does die. The next morning, Carter gets up and walks out of his room to find Sprinkles bleeding profusely from their head. Then, the Brannocks call the police to find out who broke into their home and killed Sprinkles. The detective tells them there’s nothing he can do because there’s no proof that someone broke in. He continues and says that all the doors were locked, and there were no signs of forced entry. By the end of the season, we never find out who killed Sprinkles.The Watcher is now available to stream on Netflix.Here’s more content on The Watcher to check out!

          <p>The internet was in hysterics after a cat brought a ferret friend home to play.Cats are sometimes known to protect their personal space and are wary of anything that interferes with that, but in one instance, a cat appeared to have made friends with a neighborhood ferret and even brought him home for a snack.While ferrets are considered to be social animals - recommended to be kept in pairs - there are several considerations that should be factored in when introducing them to other species.File photo of cat and ferret.

          <p>BILLINGS — Life in the animal kingdom is tough, and bouncing back from the edge of extinction is even tougher. But that’s exactly what the black-footed ferret is trying to do with a little help from animal biologists.&quot;These animals genetically were down to seven animals. Only seven animals left that were breeding and so to know that their numbers are bouncing back, there’s about 300-400 out in the wild right now. It’s a true success story. We released 18 of these incredibly endangered, one of the most endangered animals in North America, back to their natural habitat and it was an amazing experience,&quot; said Jeff Ewelt, executive director at ZooMontana.Prior to 1981, most biologists believed the black-footed ferret was extinct, but that all changed one day on the Hog family ranch near Meetee…</p>

          <p>BRYAN, Texas (KBTX) - It’s not every day that veterinarians at the Texas A&amp;M Small Animal Teaching Hospital (SATH) get to sew a pacemaker onto a beating heart roughly the size of a grape!But when Hypnos, a 5-year-old ferret, arrived at the SATH with a very slow heart rate, his veterinary team took on the challenge of helping the beloved pet return home healthy to his owner and ferret friends. This was the first ferret pacemaker procedure at the SATH in almost 10 years.Copyright 2022 KBTX. All rights reserved.</p>

Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … by I don’t know about you, but there have been times in my life when I’ve been so tired that I thought I would just wake up and go back to bed. It’s not uncommon to feel this way after a long day at work or a night out with friends. However, there are times when this feeling can be more intense and last for several days. If you find yourself in this situation, it’s important to listen to your body and get the rest you need.It can be hard to let go of the things you need to do in order to get some rest, but it’s important to remember that your health comes first. If you’re feeling exhausted, try to take a nap or go to bed early. And if you find yourself struggling to stay awake, don’t be afraid to ask for help. There’s no shame in admitting that you need some assistance.In short, don’t push yourself too hard if you’re feeling tired. Get the rest you need and take care of yourself. Your body will thank you for it.</p>

Informal articles are not typically written in English. If you are writing informally in English, it is best to use simple language and sentences. However, if you want to write a formal article in English, it is important to use proper grammar and punctuation. An example of a formal article about toast climbing onto someone to be carried is provided below.
Carrying Toast
Toast loves to be carried around, but he knows that eventually he will tire out his owner. So, when he sees his owner sitting down, he climbs up onto them so they will carry him. This is a cute trick that Toast has learned and it always gets a smiles from his owner.</p>

Now, however, it appears that the scientific community is largely in agreement that ferrets should, in fact, be classified as domestic animals.The primary argument in favor of classifying ferrets as domestic animals is that they have been domesticated for centuries, and are significantly different from their wild ancestors. Ferrets were first domesticated in Europe over 2,000 years ago, and were brought to the United States in the 1800s. They have been bred in captivity for generations, and their be…</p>

Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … Falling down the stairs is a hazard that many people face on a daily basis. This can be a particular problem if the stairs are in a public place, such as in a shopping centre or office block. Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened to me last week.I was descending a flight of stairs in my workplace when I suddenly lost my footing and tumbled all the way down, landing in an undignified heap at the bottom. Fortunately, I was not seriously injured, though I did suffer some bruising.This incident has led me to think about the safety of stairs in our society. Surely, there must be a better way to design them so that accidents like mine are less likely to happen? I would like to see a change in the way that stairs are built so that they are safer for everyone.</p>

          <p>My mega-chonker hambeast Kevin. He comes in at 4.3 pounds and is 2 feet long.
In today’s world, it’s not uncommon to see massive animals. But Kevin, my mega-chonker hambeast, takes the cake. He comes in at 4.3 pounds and is 2 feet long!
I adopted Kevin 8 months ago from a local shelter. At the time, he was a chonky boy, but he has truly blossomed into a magnificent hambeast. His thick fur is soft and luxurious, and he has the cutest little face.
 Kevin loves to eat, as you might expect. His favorite foods are carrots, apples, and bananas. He also enjoys the occasional ham bone. Kevin is very active and loves to play. He is especially fond of chasing his tail.
As you can see, Kevin is a very special animal. He brings joy to everyone who meets him. I am so lucky to have him in my life!</p>

          <p>I’m Bikke from Marshall Ferret and Butterscotch born on January 19, 2019. Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … We all know the saying, “April showers bring May flowers.” But what about the hidden gem of April- the moss! Too often we focus on the flowers and forget about the low-lying foliage that is essential to any garden.As we head into April, now is the time to start thinking about adding some moss to your landscape. Moss is a great way to add texture and interest to your garden. It can also help to control erosion on slopes and in shady areas where grass has a difficult time growing.If you’re thinking about adding moss to your garden, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, moss does best in cool, moist areas. so, if you live in a hot, dry climate, you may want to consider growing moss in a container instead of in your garden beds. Second, moss is a slow-growing plant, so be patient and be prepared to wait a few months for it to really start filling in.If you’re looking for a low-maintenance plant that will add a touch of beauty to your garden, consider moss. Just be sure to give it the cool, moist conditions it needs to thrive.</p>

I’ve gone from being a scared, shy person to someone who is confident and outgoing. I’ve made new friends and accomplished things that I never thought I could. I’m not the same person I was a year ago, and I’m grateful for that. I’m looking forward to seeing what the next year brings.</p>

When it comes to finding the best friends, it is important to know what qualities to look for in a friend. A good friend should be someone who is loyal, honest, and supportive. They should also be someone who makes you laugh and is always there for you when you need them.
There are many different kinds of friends, and it is important to find the ones that best suit you. Some people prefer to have a small group of close friends, while others like to have a large group of friends. There is no right or wrong answer when it comes to the number of friends you have, but it is important to have friends that you can count on.

I was surprised when my brother sent me a text message with a link to a news article. The article was about a new type of cancer treatment that is showing promise in early clinical trials. He knows that I am interested in new developments in cancer research, so he thought I would find the article interesting. I did find it interesting, and I’m glad he sent it to me.</p>

Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 … If you’ve been waiting to take your computer in for service because you can’t find a babysitter for your ferret, you’re in luck. Your wait is almost over.On April 1, Best Buy will begin offering ferret check and pick-up service at all of its stores in the United States. The service, which is free of charge, will allow customers to drop off their computers for service and pick up their ferrets at the same time.According to Best Buy, the new service was created in response to customer feedback. “We know that our customers love their ferrets, but they also need their computers fixed,” said a spokesperson for the retailer. “This new service will make it easier for them to get both done at the same time.”To take advantage of the new service, customers can bring their ferrets to any Best Buy store during regular business hours. A Best Buy employee will then check the ferret for any health concerns and provide a temporary cage for the animal while the customer’s computer is being serviced.Once the computer is ready, the customer can pick up both the computer and the ferret at the customer service desk. Best Buy says the entire process should take about two hours.So if you’ve been putting off getting your computer fixed because you didn’t want to leave your furry friend behind, there’s no need to worry any longer. Best Buy has you covered.</p>

My croissant is the best! It’s fluffy and buttery and just perfect. I could eat it every day.
I’m not sure what it is about croissants that makes them so special, but they just are. They’re the perfect breakfast food or snack. And, they’re so easy to make!
If you’ve never had a croissant, you’re missing out. But, thankfully, they’re not hard to find. Most bakeries sell them, and you can even find them in some grocery stores.
So, next time you’re looking for something special, pick up a croissant. I promise, you won’t be disappointed.</p>

          <p>It’s time for the Ferret Room Tour. It has been so exciting turning my idea into reality. The room is not quite done, there are still … I figured out what I wanted in my ferret room and how to get it without spending a fortune. I’m going to share my ideas with you in hopes it will give you some ideas for your own ferret room. My ferret room is approximately 3m x 5m. I have two large cages, one is 2m x 2m and the other is 1.5m x 2m. I also have a small cage, approximately .6m x .6m, which I use as a hospital cage. My room also has a double door entry, which I find very useful. I’ve outfitted the room with a window unit air conditioner and a space heater. I have a few large fans that I use to circulate the air and I keep the room very clean. The floor is covered with linoleum tile, which is easy to clean and keep sanitary.I built my own cages using PVC pipe and wire mesh. I find that this is the best material to use for cages because it is easy to clean and disinfect. It is also strong and sturdy, which is important when you have large ferrets. I build my own cages because I can make them any size that I want and I can put them wherever I want in the room. I have a total of four ferrets, two males and two females.I’ve furnished the room with liberal amounts of sensory enrichment toys, hammocks, beds, and tunnels. I want my ferrets to be happy and healthy, so I make sure they have plenty of things to do. I also have a large play area that I built using PVC pipe and wire mesh. This is where my ferrets can run and play when I am not able to provide one-on-one play time.My room is very important to me and I have put a lot of thought into it. I hope that this tour has given you some ideas for your own ferret room.</p>

          <p>Just got my first stinky noodle baby after wanting one for years!
Motherhood is a beautiful thing. The moment a woman becomes a mother, her whole life changes. She is no longer just a woman, but a mother. And a mother’s love is like no other.
So, when a woman finally becomes a mother after years of wanting to be one, it is a very special moment. This was the case for one woman, who got her first “stinky noodle baby” after wanting one for years.
The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, had always wanted to be a mother. But, for one reason or another, it just hadn’t happened. So, when she finally became a mother, she was over the moon.
And her new baby, who she has lovingly named her “stinky noodle baby”, is just perfect. She is everything the woman has ever wanted in a child and more.
The woman is now enjoying every moment with her new baby and is relishing in the fact that she is finally a mother. She is grateful for the moment that she finally got her “stinky noodle baby” and is looking forward to all the wonderful moments to come.</p>

          <p>Ferrets Billy and Gina swimming first time in the ocean.) Хорьки Билли и Джина в первый раз купаются в океане.) On a recent sunny day, my ferrets and I took a trip to the beach. This was their first time swimming in the ocean, and they loved it!After digging holes in the sand and rolling around in the waves, they were ready to take on the big blue. They paddled and splashed around like little puppies, and had a blast chasing the seagulls.It was so much fun to watch them experience the beach for the first time. Their joy and enthusiasm was contagious, and I’m already looking forward to our next trip.</p>

          <p>I’m watching a friend’s ferret this week and sending them as many cute photos as I can
As anyone who has ever owned a pet knows, the experience can be immensely rewarding. From the moment you first bring them home, to the silly things they do that always make you laugh, to the unending loyalty they show you, pets can quickly become some of the most important members of the family. This is why, when a friend or family member has to go out of town and can’t take their furry (or scaly, or feathered) friend with them, it’s such a kind act to volunteer to petsit.
This week, I am fortunate enough to be taking care of a friend’s ferret. While I’ve never owned a ferret myself, I have done my research and feel confident in providing the little guy with the care and attention he needs. I’m also excited to be able to send my friend lots of photos and updates while they’re away, so they can rest assured that their ferret is in good hands.
There’s something really special about the bond between humans and their pets, and I’m grateful to be able to experience it firsthand this week. Taking care of a pet is a responsibility that shouldn’t be taken lightly, but it’s also a lot of fun. If you ever have the opportunity to petsit for a friend, I highly recommend it!</p>

          <p>Hate to break it to you but &quot;ferret proofing&quot; is an endless battle between you and your ferret. That&#x27;s because these weasels are gifted problem solvers and they see any new barrier as a challenge rather than a limit (maybe that&#x27;s a lesson we should all take with us in life actually??). I use this ferret gate to keep my ferret restricted to his room (my office). It&#x27;s especially useful when he&#x27;s on a plant-digging rampage or I need to contain him while I clean the other rooms of the house. Try as he might, he has not been able to climb over it! Have you guys used anything similar?
