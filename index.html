          <p>What Do Ferrets Eat?
The short answer: meat, bones, and organs.
The easiest way to venture a guess as to what a ferret should eat is to look at their teeth. Does this ferret’s mouth (above) remind you of any other animals’ mouths you may know?
To me it looks an awful lot like a small dog or cat, NOT a rat or a mouse.
These ferret&#x27;s teeth are sharp in order to tear through the meat and bone of their prey! How cool!

          <p>I had the absolute pleasure of presenting about ferrets to children in an organization called Royal Family Kids (which serves neglected and abused children in the foster care system). It was so fun to teach the kids something and make them laugh.
This program has absolutely changed my life and touched my heart in ways I never would’ve expected.  
“He comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others. When they are troubled, we will be able to give them the same comfort God has given us.”

          <p>Tay-K is speaking out about the conditions he says he’s enduring while behind bars, likening his treatment to that of a “hamster” and a “ferret.”To recap: Tay-K was sentenced to 55 years in prison in 2019 in connection with the shooting death conviction of 21-year-old Ethan Walker. On Tuesday, the “The Race” artist updated fans via a three-tweet series of updates, starting with opening up about feeling as though he’s “[at] war within.”From there, Tay-K addressed his treatment while incarcerated by bringing in the aforementioned hamster and ferret comparisons.“I feel like a hamster in here,” Tay-K said in one tweet. In another, he said he was “literally” being treated “like a ferret in here rn.”See more below.Image via Tay-K on TwitterImage via Tay-K on TwitterImage via Tay-K on TwitterAs previously reported, Tay-K earlier this month questioned his 55-year sentence in a string of social media updates.“I bet if I was a lil white kid they wouldn’t have gave me no 55 years for a crime I was alleged to play the most insignificant role in when I was 16….they woulda rightfully argued that my mind wasn’t fully developed and gave me rehabilitation and a 2nd (1st) chance at adulthood,” he said at the time.Previous updates from Tay-K include a birthday-timed message on his 21st birthday in 2021, notably including comments about then-impending new music and his take on going platinum with his aforementioned hit “The Race.” Read more at this link.</p>

“I walked out of Time Warner after shopping at Whole Foods and almost collided with it. Then about 30 people including me were taking pics and following it. It walked alongside the entire front of the mall, then darted under a cop car. Some animal-loving woman tried to lure it back but it crossed the road and ended up in Columbus Circle. The woman and a guard from Time Warner (on his phone alerting security) threw a coat over it but it ran out from under. By this point, the crowd grew and I left!  No owner showed up. You never know!!”</p>

          <p>Hello lovely people. I just want to say thank you for following my journey with ferrets these last 8 years. It is such a blessing to be able to geek out about ferrets with you all. 
I have always loved animals but like I&#x27;ve said before, I think all along I was just looking for a ferret! They are the perfect pet in so many ways. Don&#x27;t you agree? 
Was anyone else just looking for ferrets all along too? Why do they fit us so perfectly?
Love you all!
P.S. the sweatshirt in this picture is from my Etsy shop (link in bio)! It says &#x27;Ferrets&#x27; in the style of the Friends TV show logo.
