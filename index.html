          <p>When a volunteer from Antioch Animal Services came into their building and said she saw what appeared to be a sick domesticated ferret on the ground outside in the parking lot, staffers quickly went into action to investigate and corral the little guy to help him.
As it turned out, however, what they found in the parking lot wasn‚Äôt one of the playful, mischievous brown-pelted animals but instead one of their wild distant cousins called a mink.
‚ÄúAt first, we did think it was a ferret,‚Äù said Melissa Ethridge from Antioch Animal Services. ‚ÄúWe kept him warm and comfortable overnight until another volunteer came in and said they thought it was a mink.‚Äù
It turns out that minks and ferrets do really look quite alike. They‚Äôre both from the mustelid family, along with polecats, weasels, badgers, ot‚Ä¶</p>

          <p>Hello lovely people. I just want to say thank you for following my journey with ferrets these last 8 years. It is such a blessing to be able to geek out about ferrets with you all. 
I have always loved animals but like I&#x27;ve said before, I think all along I was just looking for a ferret! They are the perfect pet in so many ways. Don&#x27;t you agree? 
Was anyone else just looking for ferrets all along too? Why do they fit us so perfectly?
Love you all!
P.S. the sweatshirt in this picture is from my Etsy shop (link in bio)! It says &#x27;Ferrets&#x27; in the style of the Friends TV show logo.

          <p>Watch Where You Step: Ferrets love to sleep in clothes that smell like you. Dirty clothes smell the strongest so don‚Äôt be surprised if you find your ferret curled up in the pajama pants you threw on the floor. This can become dangerous when you keep clothes scattered all over your floor. Think of it like a ‚Äòferret mine field‚Äô. Any piece of clothing could contain a ferret and if you step on them, you can cause serious injury. You have two options for this. You can either change your habits and keep all clothing off the floor, or you can shuffle your feet when you walk instead of stepping.

ECE (Epizootic catarrhal enteritis) is an inflammation of the intestinal lining that if left untreated can cause liver damage and death; it is a common and life-threatening illness in ferrets that is extremely contagious! It&#x27;s nickname in the ferret community is &#x27;green-slime&#x27;.
Has anybody here had experience with this one? What was it like? Thank you for sharing!

I think it&#x27;s crucial to get something that zips (vs. velcro or doesn&#x27;t have a bottom). What do you guys think?
This particular one is available in The Modern Ferret Amazon shop if you are looking for a pretty solid one.

          <p>One of the most common misconceptions surrounding ferrets is that they are a rodent (think hamster, guinea pig, rat, gerbil). Contrary to this popular belief, ferrets are in fact carnivores (think dog, cat) and were actually used to hunt rodents throughout history.
If you take a look at the Animal Kingdom Classification Chart above, you will see that ferrets are part of the Carnivore order (just like dogs and cats, meaning they eat fresh meat prey), and within that they are part of the Mustelidea family.
