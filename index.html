          <p>Story time: so I spent some time with a friend and her daughter who happened to be OBSESSED with ferrets. I told her about @themodernferret and she proceeded to tell ALL her friends at school that she was going to have a ‘ferret birthday party’ (whatever that is 😂). Anyway, I ended up having her and her siblings, her mom, and some of her friends over to learn all about Elijah the ferret! It was so fun! I love teaching people about this awesome animal! Thanks for letting me play teacher 😄 #ferret #ferrets #ferretsofinstagram(Feed generated with FetchRSS)</p>

She opened the rescue soon after she got her first pet ferret after moving to Virginia from California where owning ferrets as pets is illegal.          Over 2,000 ferrets have passed through Lamb’s Nirvana Ridge Ferret Rescue in Brandy Station.

          <p>What Do Ferrets Eat?
The short answer: meat, bones, and organs.
The easiest way to venture a guess as to what a ferret should eat is to look at their teeth. Does this ferret’s mouth (above) remind you of any other animals’ mouths you may know?
To me it looks an awful lot like a small dog or cat, NOT a rat or a mouse.
These ferret&#x27;s teeth are sharp in order to tear through the meat and bone of their prey! How cool!

          <p>I had the absolute pleasure of presenting about ferrets to children in an organization called Royal Family Kids (which serves neglected and abused children in the foster care system). It was so fun to teach the kids something and make them laugh.
This program has absolutely changed my life and touched my heart in ways I never would’ve expected.

          <p>Tay-K is speaking out about the conditions he says he’s enduring while behind bars, likening his treatment to that of a “hamster” and a “ferret.”To recap: Tay-K was sentenced to 55 years in prison in 2019 in connection with the shooting death conviction of 21-year-old Ethan Walker. On Tuesday, the “The Race” artist updated fans via a three-tweet series of updates, starting with opening up about feeling as though he’s “[at] war within.”From there, Tay-K addressed his treatment while incarcerated by bringing in the aforementioned hamster and ferret comparisons.“I feel like a hamster in here,” Tay-K said in one tweet. In another, he said he was “literally” being treated “like a ferret in here rn.”See more below.Image via Tay-K on TwitterImage via Tay-K on TwitterImage via Tay-K on TwitterAs previously reported, Tay-K earlier this month questioned his 55-year sentence in a string of social media updates.“I bet if I was a lil white kid they wouldn’t have gave me no 55 years for a crime I was alleged to play the most insignificant role in when I was 16….they woulda rightfully argued that my mind wasn’t fully developed and gave me rehabilitation and a 2nd (1st) chance at adulthood,” he said at the time.Previous updates from Tay-K include a birthday-timed message on his 21st birthday in 2021, notably including comments about then-impending new music and his take on going platinum with his aforementioned hit “The Race.” Read more at this link.</p>
