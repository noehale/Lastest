          <p>Do you guys use anything like this to contain your ferrets when you take them to outdoor spaces? 
I think it&#x27;s crucial to get something that zips (vs. velcro or doesn&#x27;t have a bottom). What do you guys think?
This particular one is available in The Modern Ferret Amazon shop if you are looking for a pretty solid one.

          <p>One of the most common misconceptions surrounding ferrets is that they are a rodent (think hamster, guinea pig, rat, gerbil). Contrary to this popular belief, ferrets are in fact carnivores (think dog, cat) and were actually used to hunt rodents throughout history.
If you take a look at the Animal Kingdom Classification Chart above, you will see that ferrets are part of the Carnivore order (just like dogs and cats, meaning they eat fresh meat prey), and within that they are part of the Mustelidea family.

          <p>WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) — A new habitat opening at the Sedgwick County Zoo will showcase a once-thought-extinct species. The Rogers Family Ferret Habitat, which will bring black-footed ferrets to the zoo, opens Wednesday, Dec. 14. The species of ferret was thought to be extinct until 1981 when a population was discovered in Wyoming. A disease nearly wiped out that population which saw its numbers drop to just 18 by 1987. Thanks to intervention, the species was saved and has started to be reintroduced into the wild.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has reintroduced around 300 captive-bred black-footed ferrets in Wyoming, South Dakota, Montana, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Kansas, New Mexico, Canada, and Mexico. The zoo has been assisting in the recovery program, including participating in annual surveys and providing funding for supplies. The exhibit officially opens with a ribbon-cutting ceremony at 3 p.m. Wednesday. Admission to the zoo will be just $2 that day.

          <p>FORT BELKNAP AGENCY, Mont. —  Native species such as swift foxes and black-footed ferrets disappeared from the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation generations ago, wiped out by poisoning campaigns, disease and farm plows that turned open prairie where nomadic tribes once roamed into cropland and cattle pastures. Now with guidance from elders and outside wildlife groups, students and interns from the tribal college are helping reintroduce the small predators to the northern Montana reservation sprawling across more than 1,000 square milesnear the U.S.-Canada border.Sakura Main, a 24-year-old Aaniiih woman who is entering Fort Belknap’s Aaniiih Nakoda College in January, is helping to locate, trap and vaccinate the severely endangered ferrets against deadly plague in a program overseen by the tr…</p>

          <p>I have been a huge animal person since I was a toddler. My parents said I always gravitated towards animals and books about nature even before I could talk. I’ve had hamsters, rats, chinchillas, hedgehogs, dogs, cats, snakes, and lizards. Now I joke that I was searching for ferrets all that time -I just didn’t know it yet!
When I got Moose (my first ferret), I wasn’t actually planning on getting a ferret at all. I went to a pet store to purchase a hedgehog with my boyfriend at the time. I had already owned one so I knew what the care would entail. However, when we arrived at the pet store where we meant to go check out the hedgehogs, we were instead struck by how playful and adorable the ferrets were. Many people describe ferrets as a combination of the best qualities of a puppy and a kitten rolled into one. I can attest to that!
There was one particular little ball of fluff that caught my eye. He was very dark brown and sat all alone in the corner. I reached my hands into the tank and plucked him out. I set this little kit in the crook of my forearm, belly up, and he gazed right into my eyes. What really struck me is how calmly he sat there staring at me and taking this world in. That baby was Moose, of course, and it was absolutely love at first sight. I have been head-over-heels for ferrets ever since that day.

          <p>Let&#x27;s talk ferret UTI&#x27;s!
They are caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the urinary systems -usually E. Coli or Staphylococcus. If left untreated, UTI’s can lead to kidney infections in ferrets.
Here are some symptoms to look out for:
Straining to pee, only peeing small amounts at a time, trying to pee but can’t, overly smelly pee. 
Have you had any experience with this one?
