          <p>JUNCTION CITY (KSNT) ‚Äì A new city ordinance has been approved in Junction City which limits the number of animals in each residence within city limits.  City Attorney of Junction City Britain D. Stites announced on Nov. 8 that the City Commission voted on and approved the new limits for animals per residence. Households may own, harbor or possess no more than six dogs, cats, ferrets or any combination of the three animals. The previous limit was set at 19, according to Stites. The City Commission determined to grandfather dogs, cats or ferrets which are licensed on or before Dec. 30, 2022 during regular business hours of the City‚Äôs Customer Service Office. Animals not licensed before January 1, 2023, shall not gain a grandfather status.  This new ordinance does not allow people to exceed the limitations on pitbull ownership or other limitations contained in the ordinances of the city. A 20-year-old pitbull ban in Junction City was lifted in 2020 allowing local residents to own two pitbulls per household.  Owners, harborers or possessors convicted of cruelty to animals or other similar ordinances and statutes shall have the grandfather status of their animals revoked.  If you have any questions, you can call the Customer Service Office at 700 N. Jefferson St. or the Junction City Animal Shelter at 2424 N. Jackson St. during their normal business hours to license your animals with the City. Bring a copy of the animal‚Äôs current rabies vaccination.  Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc.

          <p>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) - This week, 30 federally threatened black-footed ferrets were released on Colorado‚Äôs eastern plains.The ferrets, one of the rarest mammals in North America, were raised at a U.S. Fish and Wildlife breeding facility. According to CPW‚Äôs website, black-footed ferrets were thought to be extinct twice, and were absent from Colorado since the early 1940s. A small population was found in Wyoming in 1981, which was used to help boost populations in the region. Officials say that there are currently about 600 black-footed ferrets both in captivity and the wild, and that all black-footed ferrets are now descendants of that population found in Wyoming.The ferrets were first reintroduced to Colorado back in 2001. This week‚Äôs release marks the eighth release site in eastern Colorado. The ferrets were released land owned by the Southern Plains Land Trust.See video of the release from Colorado Parks &amp; Wildlife here:Copyright 2022 KKTV. All rights reserved.</p>

          <p>Ferrets are pretty cool pets. They‚Äôre friendly, smart, super curious and fun to hang out with!But when it comes to taking care of your new friend, you might be wondering ‚Äî what do ferrets eat?To find out what the best foods are to feed your ferret (and those to avoid), we reached out to Samantha Henson, a certified clinical pet nutritionist with Next Generation Pet Wellness, and Dr. Robert Fillman, a veterinarian at GeoZoo (and ferret parent!).What do ferrets eat?Well, for starters, ferrets are carnivores ‚Äî or more specifically, obligate carnivores. This means that their diet should consist of at least 70 percent meat.‚ÄúMuch like tigers, alligators and snakes, ferrets need meat to survive and cannot turn plant proteins into what their bodies need,‚Äù Henson told The Dodo. ‚ÄúThey thrive on a di‚Ä¶</p>

          <p>The Watcher. (L to R) Luke David Blumm as Carter Brannock, Bobby Cannavale as Dean Brannock in episode 102 of The Watcher. Cr. Eric Liebowitz/Netflix ¬© 2022A new mystery-thriller series titled¬†The Watcher is now streaming on Netflix. It follows a family who after moving into their dream home, begins receiving threatening letters from a mysterious stalker called ‚ÄúThe Watcher.‚Äù While watching the series, you might start to have questions. Actually, a question we‚Äôre seeing being asked a lot revolves around a ferret.Spoilers from The Watcher ahead!We‚Äôre introduced to the ferret in episode 1. As the Brannock family moves into the 657 Boulevard house, Carter comes down the stairs carrying his pet ferret named Sprinkles. He asks Dean where the ferret‚Äôs leash is, and Dean replies that he doesn‚Äôt know. Then, Dean tells Carter not to let Sprinkles run all over the house because he doesn‚Äôt want them peeing everywhere.¬†Later in the episode, we find out that Dean and Nora bought Carter the ferret to make him feel comfortable about moving into the new house.Flash forward further into the episode, Sprinkles escapes from their cage and ventures around the house as the Brannocks are asleep. But then the ferret is snatched up by a person with black gloves. So, what happens to Sprinkles? Do they die?Sadly, Sprinkles does die. The next morning, Carter gets up and walks out of his room to find Sprinkles bleeding profusely from their head. Then, the Brannocks call the police to find out who broke into their home and killed Sprinkles. The detective tells them there‚Äôs nothing he can do because there‚Äôs no proof that someone broke in. He continues and says that all the doors were locked, and there were no signs of forced entry. By the end of the season, we never find out who killed Sprinkles.The Watcher is now available to stream on Netflix.Here‚Äôs more content on¬†The Watcher¬†to check out!
