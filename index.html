          <p>MIDDLETON, Wis. (WMTV) - Middleton Police are asking local residents if they or anyone they know are missing their furry friends after finding three ferrets this week, they announced in a Facebook Post.One of these slinky animals was found near Maywood Avenue and Allen Boulevard this week, and two others were recovered from the same area later, officials said.Though they might look similar to minks, these are domesticated ferrets that have become more popular in the US as pets in the past few years, according to the Humane Society of the United States.If you are missing a ferret, The Middleton Police Department asks that you email tomkarman@sbcglobal.net or contact The Dane County Humane Society.Copyright 2022 WMTV.

          <p>To capture what‚Äôs happening in global markets, think of a ferret in a newsroom. Back in the heyday of Fleet Street, Kelvin MacKenzie,¬†one of Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs favorite tabloid editors, would yell, ‚ÄúFerret up trousers!‚Äù when a big story¬†broke¬†and everyone had to drop what they were doing to work on it. If that story then turned out not to be true, even closer to deadline and¬†requiring desperate work, he‚Äôd shout,¬†‚ÄúReverse ferret!‚Äù¬†Markets are executing a classic reverse ferret.The key, as I‚Äôve often said recently,¬†is a change in the belief on whether the economy can withstand the higher rates that the Federal Reserve says that it‚Äôs¬†going to impose in a bid¬†to quell inflation.

          <p>To the editor: Ferrets are adorable. Yet as much fun as it was to see their cute faces in the Los Angeles Times, it was even better to read that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who professed his love for ferrets after co-starring with one, had the good sense and conscience to veto a bill that would have legalized them as pets. Ferrets owned as pets will either be condemned to life indoors or will be outdoors ravaging wildlife. We already face that dilemma with the cats so many of us adore. We would be foolish to invite a repeat scenario with another strictly carnivorous species, whose members deserve better lives than what we can offer them inside our homes where they will be, too often, kept in cages. No animal should have to suffer that for the crime of being irresistible. Karen Dawn, Santa Barbara The writer is executive director of DawnWatch, an animal advocacy nonprofit...To the editor: While your June 28 article on ferrets and the decades-longs push to legalize the adorable animals in California was touching and motivational to gain support for the cause, it comes way too late to get the required signatures by June 30. If only you had published it weeks ago.Kevin Sutlick, Long Beach</p>

Merlin, living up to his masked ‚Äúbandit‚Äù markings, chased Astro, who shimmied through a crinkly plastic tunnel in a frantic effort to get away. Watching him interact with the humans in his life, Astro gave every indication that he would rather cuddle with them than tussle with his cage mate.‚ÄúThey‚Äôre so much fun and bring me so much joy,‚Äù said Pat Wright, who keeps the three ferrets in his San Diego-area home, along with a corgi and an English shepherd. ‚ÄúHow anyone can see these pets as a threat‚Ä¶</p>
