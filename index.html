          <p>I‚Äôm Bikke from Marshall Ferret and Butterscotch born on January 19, 2019. Ferret World Nakano store on April 15, 2019 ‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre thinking about moving the toilet in your home, think again. It may seem like a good idea to change the location of the toilet, but there are a few things you need to consider before you make the change.For starters, the location of the toilet is determined by the home‚Äôs sewer line. The sewer line is the pipe that carries waste water from the home to the municipal sewer system. The location of the sewer line is typically governed by building codes, which means that if you move the toilet, you may also need to move the sewer line. This can be a costly and time-consuming project.Additionally, the toilet is connected to the home‚Äôs water supply. This means that if you move the toilet, you‚Äôll also need to reroute the water supply lines. This can be a tricky process, and if it‚Äôs not done correctly, it could result in a leak.Finally, you need to take into account the fact that the toilet is one of the most-used fixtures in the home. This means that relocating it could be a major inconvenience for you and your family.Therefore, before you make the decision to move the toilet, weigh the pros and cons carefully. It may be best to leave the toilet where it is.</p>

          <p>‚ÄúGuys, look! The tube is back!‚Äù
After a long day at work, there is nothing better than coming home and plopping down in front of the TV to relax. But what if your TV is broken? You may be in for a long, frustrating night.
But don‚Äôt despair! There are a few things you can do to try to fix your TV. First, check all the connections. Make sure the power cord is plugged in and that the TV is set to the correct input. If everything looks good there, try pressing the power button again.
If your TV still won‚Äôt turn on, there could be a problem with the power supply. Try unplugging the TV for a few minutes and then plugging it back in. If that doesn‚Äôt work, you may need to replace the power supply.
If your TV turns on but there is no picture, the first thing to check is the input. Make sure you have selected the correct input. If that doesn‚Äôt work, try adjusting the antenna or cable connection.
If you‚Äôre still having problems, it‚Äôs time to call a TV repairman. But don‚Äôt give up hope! With a little troubleshooting, you may be able to fix your TV yourself.</p>

          <p>Jasper showed Rusty how to play with the scratching post, so he finally checked it out. He is not very athletic. üôÇ Rusty the ferret is back with another clip from his latest adventure. This time he is at the post office and things are not going well. The postal worker is not very helpful and Rusty is not getting his mail. Will he ever get it?</p>

          <p>My wife got this picture and it made my three look like Cerberus
Cerberus, also known as the ‚Äúhellhound‚Äù, is a fearsome creature from Greek mythology. He is said to have three heads, each of which can breathe fire, and he guards the entrance to the Underworld.
So it‚Äôs no wonder that one father was surprised to see his three young children pictured with the dog-like creature in a photo his wife had taken. The children are pictured looking up at the camera with Cerberus in the background, and the father is clearly amazed by the resemblance.
While it is certainly an unusual picture, it is also a very cute one. It‚Äôs clear that the children are not afraid of the so-called ‚Äúhellhound‚Äù and, in fact, seem to be quite fond of him.
This is just one example of the power of imagination and the ability of children to see the world in a different way to adults. It‚Äôs a reminder that, sometimes, the seemingly impossible can be completely believable to those with less experience of the world.</p>

          <p>Big news everyone! I adopted a new ferret! He is two years old and his name will be revealed when I post my upcoming YouTube video that talks all about him!
How he landed in my lap is a funny story too, which I‚Äôll talk all about soon! 
Stuff I love about this little dude: he naps with me in my hammock, he follows me everywhere, and he war dances like crazy!
Also, my dream was always to have a ferret that would happily CHOOSE to sleep on the bed with me. Well, one day recently my little dude figured out how to climb up my bed. And what did he do once he got there? Promptly curled up and fell asleep.
He has been such a blessing during this time in my life. He does remind me a lot of Moose. More info to come!
Love you all!

          <p>PHOENIX ‚Äî The Phoenix Zoo gave names to four of its new 21 endangered black-footed ferret kits through voting from Valley residents online.
With over 2,100 votes, the names selected in a landslide were Maple, Acacia, Cedar and Willow, according to a press release.
The Phoenix Zoo is one of six zoos worldwide that breeds black-footed ferrets, one of the most endangered North American species, that ultimately get released back into the wild. ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to have another successful black-footed ferret breeding season and excited for these little kits to grow up and contribute to the recovery of their species,‚Äù Director of Conservation and Science at the Phoenix Zoo. Dr. Tara Harris said.
The zoo has produced over 500 black-footed ferrets in the 30 years that it has been breeding the animals. In 2021, 13 ferrets were released back into the wild in Colorado.
The kits live in specially designed den boxes with their mothers, according to the release,

          <p>AUSTINTOWN, Ohio (WKBN) ‚Äì A neglected dog and five ferrets are safe after being rescued by an Animal Charity humane agent Thursday. ‚ÄúSomeone left them there intentionally. Tyson is extremely underweight. He is starved, almost to death,‚Äù said Jane MacMurchy, operations director at Animal Charity. Tyson weighed only 46 pounds. He was found in an abandoned Austintown apartment, collapsed in a bathroom, unable to stand, according to an Animal Charity Facebook post.  ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt just a situation where maybe somebody left their animal with somebody else to take care of, you know it was very clear that they were intentionally abandoned and left to starve,‚Äù MacMurchy said. MacMurchy says Tyson was cached with urine and feces, because he couldn‚Äôt stand up to use the bathroom. She said the ferrets were dehydrated and lethargic. ‚ÄúIt took a village to save Tyson and five ferrets seemingly left to die in an apartment yesterday,‚Äù the post stated. Animal Charity did not have a vet on staff yesterday so they called Friends Of Fido MCDP and Tyson was rushed to a local vet clinic for emergency care. Tyson was given lifesaving fluids and started on small meals to slowly reintroduce his body to food. He was also given a bath to remove the caked-on feces and urine.  The ferrets were given lifesaving fluids and a slow introduction to food as well. MacMurchy says they will be pressing criminal charges against the owner, which may include animal cruelty and prohibitions concerning animals. ‚ÄúThe first step is the probable cause hearing, then the next step is to pursue criminal charges,‚Äù she said. Both Tyson and the ferrets are doing well and in the care of Animal Charity. Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
