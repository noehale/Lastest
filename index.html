          <p>Published¬†June 3, 2022 8:40PM    QUAKERTOWN, Pa. - A Pennsylvania pet store is asking¬†for the safe return of two ferrets it says were stolen by a woman from a glass enclosure.¬† The apparent theft happened Thursday afternoon at Pets Plus in Quakertown.¬† Surveillance footage shared by the store shows the woman making sure the coast is clear before reaching into the enclosure and grabbing the ferrets.  After she picks up the animals, the woman is seen making a beeline for the store&#x27;s front entrance.¬† According to wildlife experts, young ferrets need a lot of attention and the proper food in order to thrive.¬† The store is urging anyone with information on the alleged theft to come forward.</p>

Times correspondent Homer Glen‚Äôs Ethel Rodriguez loves ferrets so much that she has eight. It wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if she picked up a few more.But, for now, eight it is and after careful study of each ferret‚Äôs behavior, Rodriguez gives them suitable names.There&#x27;s Bradley J. Barrett, Buddy Hart, Esmeralda Farnsworth and Daffodil Darling among them.Rodriguez has taken her love for the unique pets to a level in which she is the treasurer for the Greater Chicago Ferret Association and chair of the Woozlefest, which she brought to Lockport for the 11th time April 23.The fest was held at the Lockport American Legion Post 18 and brought ferret lovers from as far away as Niles, Mich., and Urbana.It was Shelby Altman, who came from Urbana for her first Woozlefest.

          <p>ALTOONA, Pa (WTAJ)‚ÄìThe four beloved pet ferrets of the Altoona Area Public Library are making national headlines by being featured in the recent edition of the American Ferret Association magazine. The four ferrets are considered ambassadors for the library as many people come to see them. They currently reside on the children‚Äôs floor of the library. The magazine featured the pets on a three-page spread, talking about their lives and how they came to the library. Children‚Äôs Service Supervisor Kristy Wall said the magazine discovered them from their annual calendar. Of the four ferrets, two belong to Wall. Draco is three years old. Maya is four years old and was a library donation. Apollo is three years old, and Juniper is two years old.  Wall said that children and families love playing with the ferrets when they visit. It‚Äôs also an opportunity to teach more about animals and how to handle them. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs wonderful they represent all ferrets,‚Äù Wall said. ‚ÄúFerrets are wonderful creatures, and people don‚Äôt know as much about them. So, it‚Äôs a great opportunity to educate people about how wonderful they are.‚Äù Wall said she was not expecting a three-page spread in the magazine, and she looks forward to seeing the community‚Äôs response.
